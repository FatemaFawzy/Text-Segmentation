438 7. JFK OF WALTER QUINTIN ORE SHAM 

"the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, all contested matters were "
required to be heard by the judge; the register duties were 
largely if not purely ministerial. 

My husband had suggested to General Grant the ad 
"visability of making Benjamin H. Bristow, who was then "
"United States District Attorney for Kentucky, Solicitor of "
the Treasury. General Grant liked General Bristow so well 
"that he first made him Solicitor-General and afterwards, "
"in 1874, promoted him to be Secretary of the Treasury. "
"Major Bluford Wilson, United States District Attorney for "
"the Southern District of Illinois, was, upon the request "
"of General Bristow, appointed in June, 1874, Solicitor of the "
Treasury. Major Wilson was the brother of Major-General 
"James Harrison Wilson, who had been in the early days of "
the war on General Grant s staff. During the days off from 
court my husband made trips to Washington. Long before 
they became public he heard the rumors about Secretary of 
War Belknap. Belknap had been his friend in the field. 
"In April, 1875, Bristow told my husband that extensive "
frauds had been discovered in the Internal Revenue Depart 
"ment, which were then being secretly investigated. "

"General Henry V. Boynton, of the Associated Press, and "
"George Fishback, one of the owners of the St. Louis Globe- "
"Democrat, brought to Solicitor Wilson the first evidence of "
"the existence of the ""Whiskey Ring."" Major Wilson "
immediately took General Boyn ton s and Mr. Fishback s 
"evidence to Secretary Bristow, and with the sanction of "
his chief pressed the investigation and then the prose 
"cutions. Aggressive and fearless, Major Wilson was a man "
after my husband s own heart. 

The distillers and rectifiers of whiskey and high wines 
"at Cincinnati, Evansville, St. Louis, Chicago, Pekin, and "
Milwaukee had for several years been defrauding the govern 
ment of much revenue by a systematic system of bribing 
"revenue officers, many of whom were active associates in "
the wide-spread conspiracy. 



WHISKEY RING TRIALS

General Bristow and Major Wilson laid the matter be 
"fore General Grant, who later, in a personal letter to Bris "
"tow, wrote his famous epigram, ""Let no guilty man escape."" "
"Aside from doing their duty, Secretary Bristow and Solici "
"tor Wilson were General Grant s loyal friends, but when "
they discovered the connection of the President s private 
"secretary, Orville Babcock, with the conspiracy, through "
"a telegram in Babcock s own handwriting, General Grant "
"became first cold, then enraged, and afterwards said they "
were trying to smirch him. Nothing was further from their 
thoughts. General Grant claimed to believe in Babcock s 
innocence. He was incensed when Babcock was indicted 
"at St. Louis, and finally the breach thus occasioned led "
Bristow to retire from the cabinet. Early in the investi 
gations my husband was summoned to Washington to use 
his good offices with General Grant. It was a delicate 
"mission and for many reasons he did not want to go, but he "
felt it was his duty to do so. He found General Grant ob 
"durate, and so reported to Bristow. But he told Grant "
"that Bristow had his sympathy, was loyal, honest, and "
"capable. On this visit to Washington, after my husband s "
"call on General Grant and report to Bristow, he conferred "
"with Judge David Davis, and the two called on Bristow "
"and advised him to resign, which he did not do. "

Babcock s acquittal by a jury before United States Cir 
cuit Judge Dillon in the United States District Court at 
"St. Louis, aided by the charge of the judge and by every "
"influence the press, the Chief Executive, and the soldier "
"element could bring to bear in his behalf, confirmed General "
Grant in his opinion. 

Judge Dillon s instructions to the jury to find the de 
fendant not guilty were but little short of peremptory. 
"Patrick H. Dyer, now United States District Judge, then "
"the United States District Attorney, General John B. Hen "
"derson and Lucian Eaton, assistants, were the only men in "
"St. Louis, the newspapers said, who claimed Babcock guilty. "



440 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 



"After a half century, looking back at the facts that author "
"ized the indictment and were developed at the trial, ""it is "
"difficult,"" said Major Wilson, ""to reconcile the verdict with "
Babcock s telegrams to McDonald and his intimacy with 
"the other chiefs of the ring."" "

"One of the best court stories I ever heard was how ""Pat "
"Dyer"" closed his argument to the jury in the Babcock "
"case, in December, 1875. He started in vigorously to pre "
"sent the case for the government, but soon met with ob "
jections from Judge Dillon as to his line of argument. As 
he progressed many of his assertions were flatly contra 
"dicted by the court, and finally, after an interruption, Pat "
"said: ""Gentlemen of the Jury, I want to tell you a story. "
Two years ago I went down into southwestern Missouri 
to visit an old friend and with him to hunt w r ild turkeys. 
"My friend was an elderly man with an old smooth-bore, "
single-barrel musket loaded with buckshot. Soon we were 
on the trail of a flock of wild turkeys. My companion 
"blazed away at the biggest gobbler in the flock, but the "
only damage done was to break the gobbler s left wing. 
Then there was a foot race between the old man and the 
"gobbler, with me bringing up the rear. The gobbler led "
from the clearing to the timber. As the race proceeded 
"the old man threw away his musket, canteen, and powder- "
"horn so as to lighten ship, and was gaining on the gobbler, "
"who was weakening from loss of blood, when the old man "
stubbed his toe over a sapling some one had cut down across 
the path and went down. The gobbler w r as soon out of sight 
behind the trees and underbrush by reason of a bend in the 
"path. As he arose to his feet the old man said, I did not "
"kill you, but, by God, you won t roost as high tonight as "
"you did last night. I thank you, gentlemen, for your atten "
"tion."" Then turning to Judge Dillon very deferentially, "
"Dyer said, ""Instruct the jury, Your Honor."" Just short of "
a peremptory instruction to acquit was the gist of Judge Dil 
lon s charge. Promptly there was a verdict of Not guilty. 



WHISKEY RING TRIALS 441 

With Major Wilson in active command of the proceed 
"ings against the ring, the first acts were the seizures in "
"April, 1875, of distilleries, rectifying houses, spirits, coal, "
"and other tangible property at Cincinnati, Evansville, St. "
"Louis, Chicago, and Milwaukee. A great many of the "
"leading Internal Revenue officers, including the chief clerk "
"of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, were finally convicted "
of being in the conspiracy. The seizures were made on the 
theory that the government had a lien on the property 
seized. 

"The first trial was at Evansville, Indiana, June 9, 1875. "
The government was represented by District Attorney 
"Nelson Trussler, his assistant, Charles L. Holstein, and "
"Major Wilson, as the special representative of the Treasury "
"Department. The defendants, Gordon B. and John H. "
"Bingham, who were ably defended by Charles Denby "
"and General J. M. Shackelford, were charged with run "
ning the distillery at Patoka during the absence of the 
storekeeper. The only penalty in the event of a con 
"viction was a fine of $1,000, but because a verdict of "
"guilty w r ould be a break in the line of the ring, the case "
was vigorously defended and as vigorously prosecuted. 

The local press at Evansville sided with the defendants. 
"The Evansville Courier, in commenting on the charge of "
"Judge Gresham to the jury, said it was most severe, leaving "
no loophole for escape. There was proof that the distill 
ery was operated at night several hours after the store 
keeper had gone home to bed. This neglect of duty on 
"the part of the storekeeper, the defendants by their counsel "
"claimed, could not be regarded as a violation of the statute "
by them. The charge was that the jury should not take 
into consideration the fact that the law was a strict one; 
that it w r as the duty of the distiller to see that the store 
keeper was at the distillery while the distillery was operated; 
"that knowing the storekeeper had left the distillery, it was "
the duty of the distiller to close down the distillery and 



442 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN ORES II AM 

make complaint to the proper authority. ; The law makes 
no exception and does not inquire as to the distiller s mo 
"tives. Congress, in passing the act, knew what incentive "
to defraud the government there was in manufacturing 
"whiskey, and therefore passed strict laws to prevent even "
"an opportunity for defrauding the revenue."" There was a "
"verdict of ""Guilty."" "

This charge to the jury Major Wilson made the subject 
of a special telegram of congratulation to the Secretary of the 
"Treasury. It broke the defense all along the line. ""And "
"this pioneer trial and conviction,"" said Major Wilson, "
greatly strengthened the hands of the government in later 
"trials in Milwaukee, Chicago, and St. Louis."" "

Judge Blodgett had authorized seizures at Chicago and 
"Judge Dyer at Milwaukee, but still the government was "
without certain important evidence necessary to enforce 
"its liens for unpaid taxes, and to indict and convict. In "
every instance accurate accounts were kept by the distill 
eries of all their transactions. An inspection of these books 
would enable the government to get evidence that would 
complete its case. 

In defining the law and enforcing the liens under the 
"seizures, Major Wilson and Judge Gresham continued to "
be in the lead. The first proceeding was against Distillery 
"No. 28, Evansville. The government was in possession of "
the distillery but could not dispose of it by sale until it had 
established by evidence that the Binghams had defrauded 
the government out of its just revenue by corrupting certain 
"of the revenue officers. Furthermore, the Binghams inter "
"vened; that is, came into court and asked that their property "
be restored to them. They were represented by notable 
"counsels, Charles Denby and General J. M. Shackelford of "
"Evansville, and Harrison, Hines &amp; Miller of Indianapolis. "

Extended mention of these prosecutions is made because 
they show that the practical side in enforcing the just and 
legitimate powers of the government was never lost sight 



WHISKEY RING TRIALS 



443



"of by Judge Gresham, and also show the tendency of the "
"reviewing courts to be pedantic to play upon words, thus "
"to limit the powers of the government until finally, when "
the consequences of their own acts are brought home to 
"them, they ""distinguish"" or depart from their original "
"narrow, technical construction. All are familiar with the "
"English maxim, incorporated into the Constitution of the "
"United States, ""that no man can be compelled to give "
"evidence against himself."" To remove the embargo that "
"this put on the government, State as well as National "
acts that of Georgia before the Revolution were passed. 
"The National act, known as Section 860 of the Revised "
"Statutes of 1875, provided that in the event that a party "
was required to make a disclosure that might incriminate 
"him, this disclosure as evidence could never be used against "
"him. It was in the ""Whiskey Ring"" prosecutions that "
"Section 860 was first given effect by a Federal court, so far "
"as the records disclose. Judges Gresham, Blodgett, and "
"Dyer applied Section 860, and upheld its constitutionality "
in opinions that the Supreme Court at first refused to 
"follow. Subsequently, when the consequences of the ruling "
"were pressed home, the Supreme Court reversed itself. It "
was in these prosecutions that the differences between 
Judge Gresham and General Harrison first arose. 

"On June 25, 1875, on motion of the District Attorney "
"for the District of Indiana, as was provided by sections of "
"the Revenue Act of 1874, Judge Gresham ordered the safe "
of Distillery No. 28 opened. It was opened but found 
empty. The court then ordered the Binghams to produce 
"in the courtroom at Indianapolis on September 14, 1875, "
"the books, blotters, and journals regularly kept and those "
irregularly kept. The last mentioned showed the actual 
transactions of the distillery. The regular books were so 
incomplete that they were useless. To the production of 
"the books irregularly kept, the Binghams by their counsel "
"objected, because they said these were private papers. "



444 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

It was further objected that Section 5 of the Act of 1874 
and the order made in pursuance of it were invalid because 
"in controvention of the Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh Amend "
"ments to the Constitution of the United States, ""that the "
"rights of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, "
"papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seiz "
ures shall not be violated; that no person shall be com 
pelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself; 
and when the value of the property in dispute exceeds $20 
"in value, be deprived of his right to trial by jury."" "

There was an extended argument and a carefully pre 
pared opinion in which the court said : 

"The first Congress that sat under the Constitution, the Con "
gress that proposed to the States the first ten Amendments to 
"the Constitution, the Fourth, Fifth, and the Seventh here in "
"question, provided by Section 15 of the judiciary act for the "
production of books and papers to be used as evidence in suits 
"at law, and also as the Constitution had enjoined in order to "
"collect revenue, passed an act creating the internal revenue "
system a system that of necessity the history of all govern 
"ments shows must be drastic and arbitrary in its nature, pre "
scribing every step to be taken in the erection and management 
"of a distillery. . The government has, therefore, practically "

assumed control of the manufacture and sale of spirits; they 
[distillers] are required to keep books in which they are to enter 
daily all their business transactions with the utmost particularity. 
These books are at all times open to the inspection of the proper 
revenue officers and are popularly known as government books. 
"If properly kept, they will show the exact amount of spirits "
"produced, Teceived, and removed on any given day. If so kept, "
"they will correspond with their business books, and this corre "
spondence ought to exist. No one can engage in the manufacture 
and sale of spirits without the consent of the government. This 
consent is obtained on certain terms and conditions. No one 
can be allowed to say that a distiller or wholesale liquor dealer 
has kept a private record of his transactions. His books and 
entries are quasi-public books and entries. 

It is now too late to question the power of Congress in the 



WHISKEY RING TRIALS 



445



premises. If the so-called private books correspond with the 
"distillery books, the Binghams will not be hurt; if they do not "
"correspond, then any incriminating entries they contain can "
"never be used against the Binghams in any criminal case, because "
"the Act of Congress of 1868, Section 850, provides that the "
witnesses in all such cases should have complete immunity. 

We are not here to try the criminal case. When it comes 
"to that, there would be a jury trial. Besides, it is not a suit at "
"law or in equity, but a proceeding in rem to collect the govern "
ment revenue. 

"This opinion was read November 2, 1875, and an order "
entered that the order of July 28 stand; and in the event 
"it was not complied with, the claim of the government would "
be taken as confessed and the Binghams imprisoned for 
contempt. 

"November 12, 1875, the Binghams, by their counsel, "
"Harrison, Hines &amp; Miller, withdrew their claim to the spir "
its in Distillery No. 28 and to the distillery itself and the 
claims of the government were confessed. Subsequently 
"the Binghams were indicted, plead guilty, and became wit "
nesses for the government. 

"Eleven years later Judge Gresham s interpretation, and "
"that also of Judges Blodgett and Dyer of Wisconsin, of "
"Section 5 of the Act of 1874 as being constitutional, was "
rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States in 
Boyd vs. U. S. (116 U. S. 616) because it held that section 
provided for an unreasonable search in that it might subject 
a party to a forfeiture or a criminal prosecution to compel 
him to produce his books and invoices in a customs case. 
Little or no consideration was given to the Immunity Stat 
"ute, Section 860 of the Revised Statutes. ""It was the writs "
of assistance providing for the searches and seizures in 1761 
"that James Otis declaimed against,"" said Justice Bradley, "
that gave rise to the Fourth Amendment to the Consti 
"tution of the United States."" It was not the writs but the "
customs laws of Parliament that these writs were being 
"used to enforce, that Otis attacked. Had these revenue "



446 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

laws passed by the Parliament been passed by the colonial 
"legislatures, Otis would not have objected, but would have "
championed their enforcement by writs of assistance or 
"otherwise. So in 1890, in the Counselman case, in giving "
"effect to the Interstate Commerce Act of February 4, 1887, "
Circuit Judge Gresham distinguished the Boyd case and 
"upheld the constitutionality of Section 860, the Immunity "
Statute. 

The Counselman case arose out of an investigation by a 
United States Grand Jury for the Northern District of 
"Illinois as to whether the Rock Island, the Burlington, and "
the Santa Fe Railroad companies were violating the anti- 
rebate section of the Interstate Commerce Act. Charles 
"Counselman, a Chicago grain dealer, who, after admitting "
"he was a large shipper over the roads named, under the "
"advice of counsel refused to testify further, and especially "
in response to questions as to whether he had received re 
"bates, for the reason that his answers might tend to incrimi "
"nate him. The Grand Jury reported to Judge Blodgett, "
"who ordered Counselman to testify, because Section 860 "
granted him immunity against any future criminal prosecu 
"tion. Again Counselman refused to testify, and again he "
was ordered to testify under penalty of a fine of -$500 and 
"to stand committed until it was paid. On a habeas corpus, "
Judge Gresham sustained Judge Blodgett. 

"In 142 U. S., 547, the Supreme Court promptly and "
unanimously reversed Judges Blodgett and Gresham in the 
"Counselman case, condemned what they and Judge Dyer "
"had said in the Whiskey Ring"" cases, held Section 860 "
"void as being in contravention of the Fourth Amendment, "
and consequently upheld Counselman s refusal to answer 

"Then it was that the Chicago Tribune, in a page article "
"showed the price of grain at St. Paul, Omaha, and Kansas "
"City; at Chicago, the great grain market and gateway to "
"the East; the price at the seaboard, New York, and Balti "
more; the rates on the railroads from the first named three 



WHISKEY RING TRIALS 447 

"points to Chicago, to the seaboard; the rates from Chicago "
"to the seaboard, New York, and Baltimore; and the price "
"of grain at the seaboard, New York, and Baltimore. The "
difference in the price of wheat at Omaha and Chicago was 
much less than the freight rates between those points; the 
same was true as to St. Paul and Kansas City and Chicago; 
"the same was true as to Chicago, New York, and Baltimore. "
Counselman was doing an immense grain business. He 
owned most of the elevators on the Rock Island and had a 
practical monopoly on its lines. 

The Tribune article attracted wide attention. The in 
ference was irresistible that Counselman was receiving re 
bates and that the railroad companies under investigation 
were guilty. The decisions that went to the length that the 
witness might refuse to answer because his answers would 
"tend to degrade him in the eyes of his fellows, even if they "
"would not subject him to a criminal prosecution, were ab "
"surd, because the witness who refused to answer, accused, "
"tried, and condemned himself at the bar of public opinion. "
Congress passed another immunity statute differing not. in 
"principle from Section 860, and but little in words. At the "
first opportunity the Supreme Court sustained it. 

"In the ""Whiskey Ring"" trials at Indianapolis, includ "
"ing the two Binghams, thirty-one men were indicted by the "
Federal Grand Jury that met in that city on the first Mon 
"day in December, 1875. The indictments were for violating "
"the internal revenue laws, for conspiracy, for bribery, and "
for receiving bribes. The latter was the charge against 
"Hiram Brownlee, a young man of good family. Brownlee "
was one of the two who went to trial who were acquitted. 
"He was defended by George W. Steele of Marion, Indiana, "
"Brownlee s home; by his venerable father, who simply sat "
"in the courtroom; by General Benjamin Harrison, and his "
"partners, Messrs. Hines and Miller. It was this trial that "
evidenced the breach between Judge Gresham and General 
Harrison. The trial lawyer thought the trial judge not 



448 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"only had been hard on the Binghams, but also that he "
disregarded the constitutional limitations on his judi 
"cial powers, while the trial judge afterwards criticized the "
"length to which ""a Presbyterian elder would go"" in order to "
win a verdict. General Harrison was an elder in the First 
Presbyterian Church of Indianapolis. 

"The Brownlee jury was sworn to try the issue, Friday, "
"the 1 4th of January, 1876, and after the opening statement "
"by the government, was excused until 10 A. M. of Tuesday, "
"the 1 8th, because the court was congested with an accumu "
lation of bankruptcy business and motions for new trials 
in the case of those convicted. One of the convicted men 
was an old soldier. It had been thought the jury that tried 
him would acquit. He did not get a new trial but a sen 
"tence of two years in prison. Only one defendant, who was "
"a soldier, was acquitted. All the others were convicted or "
"plead guilty, and received sentences varying from two years "
in prison to three months in jail. The majority received 
jail sentences. Most of these sentences were imposed be 
fore the Brownlee trial was resumed on the i8th. Brownlee 
was the last to be tried. The pressure that was brought 
to bear on my husband in behalf of the defendants was 
"terrific, especially in behalf of those who had been soldiers, "
and most of them were of that class. Much of the soldier 
element resented the prosecution as a reflection on their 
Old Commander. Walter Q. Gresham could not quarrel 
"with every man who approached him, and as no surveillance "
was kept on the jurors and they were allowed to go to their 
"homes, all that was done was to w r arn them to allow no one "
to communicate with them. Even a layman can understand 
the advantage which the defense had. On the jury was a 
"man who had been a major in an Indiana regiment, a follower "
"of General Grant, and later, one of the 306 in the memorable "
"convention of 1880. A member of the machine, forceful "
"and fearless, that major never hesitated to put anything over. "
Many were the circumstances outside of the courtroom that 



RING TRIALS 449 

"contributed to, if they did not make, the verdict in the "
"Brownlee case, it was said. There never was any question "
"about District Attorney Nelson Trussler, his assistant, C. L. "
"Holstein, and the special counsel for the government, Gen "
"eral Thomas M. Brown, doing their duty. "

"When, on the i8th, the Brownlee trial was resumed, "
General Harrison made his opening statement before the 
government began its case. He assailed in advance the 
"man who was to be the government s chief witness, Gordon "
"B. Bingham, one of the indicted defendants, and his client, "
and animadverted on the spirit to convict and the harsh 
ness of construction that sometimes crept into judicial pro 
ceedings. 

In consideration of becoming witnesses for the govern 
"ment, the Binghams were promised and granted immunity. "
"Gordon B. Bingham, who was the first and chief witness "
"for the government, testified that on a certain evening in "
Brownlee s room in the St. George Hotel in Evansville he 
gave Hiram Brownlee- $500 in cash. A telegram from 
Cincinnati from Gordon Bingham to George W. Bingham 
"about Brow r nlee was admitted in evidence, and also a check "
of Gordon Bingham drawn on the Evansville Bank whereby 
he obtained the cash to hand to Brownlee. On cross-ex 
amination General Harrison led Bingham to say that when 
he gave Brownlee the second $500 in Brownlee s room in 
"the St. George Hotel in Evansville, Brownlee was putting "
on a pair of white kid gloves preparatory to starting to the 
"wedding of Harry Vcatch, the son of General Veatch, col "
lector of internal revenue for that district. 

General Yeatch was the first witness for the defense. 
He gave Brownlee a good record and said Brownlee on one 
occasion had reported to him an error in one of the dis 
tiller s books. Harry Veatch was married to a certain Miss 
Babcock at an Evansville church on a certain evening. 
"Henry Babcock, one of the groomsmen, said Brownlee, who "
"also was a groomsman, came to the Babcock residence with "



450 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

bare hands. Together they went in the carriage to get one 
of the bridesmaids. Returning to the Babcock residence 
"they met Captain W. H. Kellar, another government officer "
"and another groomsman, and Harry B. Veatch. They all "
"said Brownlee s hands were bare, and that before starting "
for the church they had put on their white kid gloves. 
Brow T nlee had two pairs and when Captain Kellar burst 
one of his gloves Brownlee gave him one of his pairs. 

"At noon on Thursday, January 20, the defense was out "
"of witnesses. At the urgent request of General Harrison, "
on the representation that Captain Kellar was on his way 
"from Evansville, the case was adjourned over the afternoon "
and until the morning of the 2ist. Meanwhile the jury 
"was permitted to separate, but with the admonition that "
they were not to talk about the case nor suffer any one to 
talk to them. 

Harry Veatch had testified that he saw Brownlee put 
on the gloves in one of the dressing rooms. Thus it was 
argued; Brownlee s denial was corroborated and Bingham s 
story discredited. Brownlee was not in the service of the 
government at the inception of the conspiracy. His ap 
"pointment was due to political influences, and these in "
fluences were strong in his defense. 

The instructions were fair to the defense unless it was 
in telling the jury that it was no contradiction of Bingham s 
testimony to show that Brownlee put on a pair of white 
gloves at General Veatch s residence. Where the white 
gloves were put on was not the controlling fact in the case. 
After telling the jury it was a rule of necessity that required 
the government to resort to an accomplice such as Bing- 
"ham to get evidence, and that they might convict on such "
"evidence properly corroborated, this language was used: "
But such testimony should be received and weighed with 
"great caution, for as a rule it is deemed unsafe to convict "
"upon the testimony of such a witness."" At the end of the "
"charge the jury was also instructed, at General Harrison s "



WHISKEY RING TRIALS 451 

"request, that they should take into consideration the good "
character the evidence showed Brownlee bore before the 
charges he then was under were made. 

"Brownlee, contrary to the predictions of the bystanders "
"and newspaper men, was acquitted, and ever afterwards "
lived an exemplary life and became a judge on the bench 
in his home county. Even if the accused is guilty there is 
often wisdom in a jury exercising the pardoning power. 
"The disgrace, anxiety, and travail of a trial are all the pun "
ishment some men need. When asked what he thought of 
"the verdict, Judge Gresham said he was satisfied, and then "
it was that he made the remark that cut General Har 
rison to the quick. If the General was not very considerate 
"of the Judge in opening the case, it cannot be said that the "
latter did not give the General s client every advantage as 
well as every right the client was entitled to under the law. 
"In other words, instead of evening up on the client, the Judge "
restrained himself and took his fling at the lawyer. 

It always made Judge Gresham more or less unwell to 
try criminal cases. It was also an unpleasant thing for 
him to have to sentence men to the penitentiary. One of 
Senator Voorhees stories will illustrate this. The episode 
occurred during a jury trial in which the Senator was one of 
the counsel. 

"During the examination of a witness, a young physician, "
who had been indicted for stealing letters from the mail 
while acting as a clerk in a small post office on the 
"Jeffersonville Railroad, was brought in by Mr. Bigelow, "
deputy United States Marshal. Judge Gresham suspended 
the examination for a moment and addressing the young 
"man, said: "

"Doctor, I have been informed that your child is dead "
and that you would like to go and be with your wife at the 
"funeral, and that so far you have been unable to attend. "
Do you know of any one who will become surety for you? 

There is no one from my home who will or can give 



452 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"the necessary bail, and I have no acquaintances or friends "
"here in the city upon whom I can call."" "

"After a little pause Judge Gresham said: ""Doctor, if "
I will let you go upon your own recognizance to attend the 
"funeral of your child, will you report back to the marshal "
"when the funeral is over?"" "

"The doctor timidly answered, ""Yes."" "

"Well, replied the judge, ""I am going to put you on "
your honor. I will allow you to go and be with your wife. 
"How long a time do you want?"" "

"Four or five days, answered the prisoner. "

"Well, take ten days, was the judge s answer, ""and "
at the end of that time report to the marshal and your case 
"will be disposed of."" "

The young fellow burst into tears and attempted to 
"utter words of thanks, but the judge waved his hand for "
"him to go and give his personal recognizance to the clerk, "
"and turning to the lawyers conducting the trial, who had "
"all been interested spectators of the scene, said quietly: "
"Gentlemen, you may proceed with the examination of "
"the witness."" "

"Senator Yoorhees, who had been standing near by, ap "
"proached him and said : ""Judge Gresham, are n t you afraid "
"that the young man you just: let go, after the funeral is "
"over, being surrounded by friends who may give him bad "
advice and tell him he need not go back that he can just 
as well go away as not may yield to such counsel and 
"not return "" "

"The answer was, ""I have frequently trusted men under "
"circumstances somewhat similar but not just like this, and "
"have never had a man go back on me yet."" Then giving "
"one of his earnest looks, he said: ""Dan, I don t care if he "
"never comes back, he shall go and bury his child."" Then, "
"pausing a second, he added: ""He ll come back."" "

"The young man came back, received a sentence which "
"was suspended, and lived to a ripe old age, a respected "



WHISKEY RING TRIALS 453 

"citizen. Many men who served ""their time"" were aided "
to get positions. One mistake does not necessarily render 
a man a criminal for life. Two of the men who helped 
open up the redoubt that night at Vicksburg had shown 
"cowardice on a previous occasion, and according to the rules "
"of war should have been shot. Instead, they were given "
light punishment and on that night proved the bravest of 
the brave.

TACTICS OPPOSED TO THE USE OF BAYONETS AT SOUTHERN 
POLLS THE HAYES-TILDEN CONTEST. 

AJOTWITHSTANDING the fact that my husband at 
-* ^ no time lost faith in Grant s personal and official 
"integrity, he turned to the nomination of Secretary of the "
"Treasury, Benjamin H. Bristow, for the Presidency. And "
"this, too, in the face of the probable failure of the Bristow "
"movement. For on February 6, 1876, he wrote to his old "
"law partner, ""I believe we could poll more votes with "
"Bristow than any one else, but I doubt if he can be nomi "
"nated. It will be said against him, Why go to Dixie for "
a candidate when the North is full of good men ? We want 
no man who has ever owned a slave. Such talk will have 
"effect in a convention."" "

Senator Morton had long been a candidate for the 
Presidency. He was in political control in Indiana and 
everything was being bent to promote his political fortunes. 
General Harrison was at this time an avowed candidate 
for the nomination for Governor of Indiana and was play 
ing politics. 

"October 14 and 15, 1875, under the guise of a non- "
"partisan soldiers reunion, a political meeting was gotten "
up at Indianapolis by Governor Morton s friends. There 
"was a great parade ending at the State House grounds, "
where Senator Morton said he had bade more than one 

454



THE ELECTION OF 1876 455 

"hundred regiments good-bye. He said to the men: ""You "
were awkward then; to-day you marched like the veterans 
you are. I have seen nothing like it since the march of 
General Sherman s army down the Avenue at the close of 
"the war."" In the march through the streets of Indianapolis "
that October day there were remnants of more than fifty 
Indiana regiments in line. One mustered 350 men with 
"flags and banners and bands. Before he concluded, Gov "
ernor Morton admitted that he was waving the bloody 
shirt and that he was still against complete amnesty. 

General Walter Q. Gresham was the only other speaker. 
"Reply, one paper designated his address. Being non- "
"partisan on the surface, as a judge, Mr. Gresham was free "
to respond to an invitation to make an address. 

After praising Governor Morton for his service during 
"the war and his devotion to the soldiers, and rapping the "
"man who stayed at home and made money, he gradually "
turned to the questions that concerned the honor and 
prosperity of the country s future. 

The soldiers of Indiana cherish no feelings of hatred for their 
late enemies. They recognize them as brave and gallant foes. 
While they believe they were mistaken and misguided in their 
"purposes, they are willing to concede that they were sincere and "
honest in their views. They do themselves no discredit in ac 
knowledging that in all soldierly qualities they were their peers. 
The soldiers earnestly desire that all unfriendly feelings engendered 
"by the unhappy conflict shall be forever forgotten, and they will "
rejoice to see the people of the South blessed with prosperity and 
happiness. 

And then he used the language which he uttered in 
General Grant s presence at an army reunion in 1879 at 
"Chicago, where he said that while the w r ar legislated it did "
"not destroy the States and local self-government, and "
deprecated the use of troops to sustain a State government. 

Walter Q. Gresham was one of General Grant s truest 
"and best friends, but gratitude and personal loyalty did "



456 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

not demand that General Grant be followed when his con 
"fidence was abused and he was misled, but rather his ten "
dencies should be resisted. In our next chapter we will 
"show that General Grant, honorable as he was, came to see "
"this. 1 For William W. Belknap, Walter Q. Gresham always "
cherished the warmest feelings of friendship. I have the 
letter from Belknap written from Washington and before 
"General Grant was elected President, in which Belknap "
wanted a letter practically a letter of introduction from 
"Mr. Gresham to General Grant, which he got. As well he "
"might, Belknap died a heartbroken man. When other "
men turned the cold shoulder to the former Secretary of 
"War after his fall, Walter Q. Gresham treated him with "
the greatest personal consideration. 

To General Harrison s aspirations to be Governor of 
"Indiana, Governor Morton and his friends proved hostile. "
"Finally, on December 10, 1875, General Harrison wrote a "
"letter to the Indianapolis Journal, withdrawing as a candi "
date for the nomination. Before the letter was published 
"it was submitted by General Harrison to Judge Gresham, "
and the judge was offered the support of General Harrison 
and his friends if he would become a candidate. This was 
before the Brownlee trial. Offers of support were coming 
from all quarters. His former law partner was urging him 
"to accept the nomination for governor, and complaining "
that he was heedless of his advice. His answer was that 
"he could not in this instance do so, and besides he was too "
busy in court to give the matter the consideration the ques 
"tion demanded, so he would keep out of it. Finally, in "
"February, 1876, word came from Governor Morton that "
Judge Gresham s nomination for governor would be accept 
able to Senator Morton and his friends. But to anything 
"that involved supporting Morton he was opposed, and the "
offer was declined. 

At this time the Bristow movement was taking form. 
"Bristow s former law partner, John M. Harlan, would come "

1 See page 469. 



THE ELECTION OF 1876 457 

"up from Louisville to confer with my husband, and some "
times he would go to Louisville to see Harlan. He would 
go Saturday evening and be back in court Monday morn 
ing. General Grant could not understand how men like 
Bristow and my husband could be loyal to him and at the 
same time insist on revealing the corruption of his faith 
less advisers. 

With a woman s instinct Mrs. Bristow could see the 
"outcome. With a sigh she said to me one day, ""General "
"Grant does n t believe Ben is loyal to him, but he is."" She "
was thinking of what might have been the result had there 
been no break between her husband and the head of the 
"administration. General Grant s resentment went so far, "
that he requested President Hayes to exclude Bristow 
from his confidence. Bristow s desire was not to be 
"President, but to be a member of the Supreme Court. "
General Grant s request and a midnight caucus thwarted 
Bristow s ambition. 

"Had General Grant continued to trust Bristow, the "
reformers would have defeated Morton and Blaine. The 
investigation of Secretary Belknap s administration of the 
War Department and the Secretary s certain impeachment 
were brought to a close by President Grant s accepting Belk 
"nap s resignation, and the political domination of Senators "
"Morton, Chandler, Carpenter, and Cameron, who had sup "
"planted and driven out of the Republican party Sumner, "
"Trumbull, and Schurz, and thus had become supreme. "
"At this time my husband was saying: ""If the probe is "
"inserted to the core, the administration of the Interior "
Department by Delano will be shown to be as corrupt as 
"that of the War Department under Be Iknap, and Robeson s "
conduct of the Navy Department will be found to be in 
"famous."" The fact that the Congressional investigations "
were not thorough and only skimmed the surface was con 
clusive to the reformers that Senator Morton and ex-Speaker 
Blaine were not proper men to be President. And the fact 



458 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

that the men in control of Congress perverted or arrested 
its judicial powers was a reason why a man on the bench 
who always kept his judicial duties free from every outside 
"influence, should use his judicial powers to the limit. "

I know my statement will be questioned that Congress 
possessed or possesses judicial powers. As Walter Q. Gres- 
"ham construed the Constitution, Congress possesses very "
important judicial functions. Investigations at which wit 
"nesses are summoned, testimony weighed, impeachments "
"recommended and tried, are the very essence of the judicial "
"power. And the possession by Senators Morton, Chand "
"ler, Carpenter, and Cameron of the power to investigate "
and impeach did not make the comparatively young judge 
hesitate to violate some of the proprieties of his position - 
if you please to put it that way and support the only re 
former in Washington. The account of the Whiskey Ring 
trials shows how a judicial question becomes a political 
"one, or is often really a mixed question in which are in "
volved political considerations. Although it involved going 
against General Grant and breaking relations with General 
"Benjamin Harrison, Walter Q. Gresham went to the logical "
"conclusion of his premises, "

"In a letter of the i2th of March, 1876, to his old partner, "
he wrote: 

"So far as I am concerned, I am ready for anything that I "
think will save the country from ruin. I have reached the point 
where I can bid defiance to political despotism and corruption. 
"In short, I am for the country, I am openly advocating Bristow s "
"claims, and I am the first man at Indianapolis that has really "
ventured that far. 

Carl Schurz proposed that there be a meeting of the 
reform element in Cincinnati a short time before the Cincin 
"nati Convention, for the purpose of coercing the Republicans "
into nominating Bristow. But this proposition was finally 
abandoned. 

The Journal of Indianapolis was supporting Senator 



THE ELECTION OF 187 6 459 

"Morton, and not a line would it allow in its columns "
"favorable to Bristow; on the contrary, it depreciated him "
in every way possible. John H. Holliday and Major 
Richards in the Indianapolis News became advocates of 
"the nomination of General Bristow, and they pressed "
his cause with great skill and force. At Mr. Holliday s 
"instance, my husband wrote to his former partner, Thom "
"as C. Slaughter, who was always facile with the pen, for "
"editorials for the News. Noble C. Butler, then living at "
"New Albany, also contributed to its columns. "

"The movement in Bristow s favor failed, but it prevented "
the nomination of either Blaine or Morton. Bristow might 
have been nominated had he been willing to .make the 
required trades. One day Senator Chandler walked into 
"Bristow s office in the Treasury Department and said, ""We "
"will nominate you if you will come along with us."" Bristow "
"promptly declined. In the convention, after the deal was "
"made at midnight to nominate Hayes, Chandler started "
the break by changing Michigan s vote to Hayes. At this 
midnight conference it is said John M. Harlan was promised 
"a place on the Supreme Bench, and he, as the head of the "
"Kentucky delegation, started the Bristow following to "
Hayes. Pennsylvania did not get into the deal. Most of 
"the independents and reformers, including Mr. Schurz and "
"all of Bristow s friends, supported Hayes at the polls. "

On the 24th day of October my husband wrote to his 
old partner : 

I have faith in Governor Hayes. Since I saw you last Sunday 
I have a letter from Mr. Schurz in which he says Governor Hayes 
does not understand the magnitude of the opposition that he 
will encounter in his own party if elected. 

In another: 

I don t say that the President did wrong in sending troops 
"into South Carolina on the call of the governor of the State, but "
I don t like the idea of bayonets in connection with elections. 
"It is contrary to our system of government. The truth is, the "



460 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"negroes arc ignorant, many of them not more than half civilized, "
"and even in those States where they outnumber the whites, they "
are no match for the whites. Mr. Lincoln was able to see that 
sooner or later the negroes in the South would be controlled by 
"the whites unless the government intervened to prevent it, and "
he was opposed to such interference. I have always thought 
he was right. I think so still. I believe his policy would have 
divided the whites of the South. Our Southern system is wrong. 
The carpet-baggers have utterly bankrupted every Southern 
State. Rebels and others have alike been robbed of their sub 
stance. We know from history that the use of bayonets in 
elections is a dangerous thing. I am afraid of such precedents. 
How long will it be until the same thing is resorted to in the 
North ! I still think it looks as if Tilden might be elected. If 
"he is, I shall hope for the best and give him a fair trial. "

With the election in doubt as the result of frauds and 
"violence on both sides, Judge Gresham was opposed to "
counting Mr. Hayes in simply because the Republicans 
had the majority in the Senate and the army at General 
Grant s back with which to do it. This was the plan of 
the radical Senators led by Senator Morton. There were 
threats of war on both sides. Ultimately a conference com 
mittee proposed to create an Electoral Commission com 
"posed of five members of the House, five members of the "
"Senate, and five justices of the Supreme Court to count the "
disputed electoral votes as a solution of controversy. It 
met with violent opposition from Senator Morton. In the 
midst of a debate in which Senator Morton was pressing 
"Senator Edmunds hard, the latter discomfited Senator "
Morton by producing a telegram from Walter Q. Gresham 
"and several others, stating that they, Republicans, favored "
"the Edmunds plan. The bill was passed, and the Com "
mission thus created carried the electoral vote for Hayes 
"by a majority of eight to seven. ""Partisan to the core"" was "
"the criticism made of that decision, and Judge Gresham "
felt that the criticism was just. The members taken from 
the Supreme Court were no less partisan than those from 



THE ELECTION OF 1876 461 

the legislative branch of the government. The only criti 
cism that was ever made of Walter Q. Gresham from a 
political standpoint was that he was not partisan enough. 
Unquestionably there was ground subsequently to say 
that Walter Q. Gresham was not always in complete unison 
with the Republican party.

REUNIONS OF ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE 



ORGANIZATION OF THE SOCIETY OF THE ARMY OF THE 

"TENNESSEE REUNIONS AT ST. PAUL, INDIANAPOLIS, AND "

CHICAGO CIVIL AND MILITARY CELEBRITIES IN ATTENDANCE 

-GENERAL GRESHAM DELIVERS ANNUAL ADDRESS IN 1879 

ENUNCIATES CONVICTIONS ON SOUTHERN POLITY. 

"SEPTEMBER i, 1877, we started with a large party to "
St. Paul to attend the eleventh annual meeting of the 
Society of the Army of the Tennessee. This society had 
been organized in the Senate Chamber of the Capitol of 
"North Carolina at Raleigh, April 14, 1865. Major-General "
"F. P. Blair, Jr., was its chief promoter: "

The object of the society shall be to keep alive and preserve 
that kindly and cordial feeling which has been one of the char 
"acteristics of this army during its career in the service, and which "
"has given it such harmony in action, and contributed in no small "
degree to its glorious achievements in our country s cause* . . . 
Honoring these glorious achievements of our brothers-in-arms 
belonging to other armies whose services have contributed in 
"equal degree to the re-establishment of our government, and "
"desiring to draw closer to them in bonds of social feeling, the "
president or either of the vice-presidents of this society shall be 
authorized to invite the attendance of any officer of the- United 
States Army at any of our annual meetings. 

The Army of the Tennessee was the military unit with 
"which, August 28, 1861, General Grant began his career. "
"Excepting himself and General E. A. Paine, all his offi "
cers were volunteers without previous military experience. 
Accorded first place by the foreign military attaches out 
"of all the organizations that ""marched down the Avenue"" "

462



REUNIONS OF ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE 463 

"in the Grand Review, with the foreigners saying that the "
"Eighth Missouri and the Eleventh Indiana, Lew Wallace s "
"old regiment, were then the best on the globe, its members "
believed what General Grant wrote of them: 

As an army it never sustained a single defeat during four 
years of war. No officer was ever assigned to the command of 
"that army who had afterwards to be relieved from duty, or "
"reduced to less command. Such a history is not by accident, "
nor wholly due to sagacity in the selection of commanders. 

"Brigadier-General John A. Rawlins, General Grant s "
"chief of staff, at that Raleigh meeting was chosen president "
"and continued as such until his death in 1869, while Secre "
tary of War under President Grant. Only thirty-nine when 
"he died, General Rawlins had been on General Grant s staff "
"since that day in August, 1861, when the Army of the "
Tennessee was formed. Colonel L. M. Dayton of General 
Sherman s staff was elected secretary and held that office 
"until his death in 1890. With Grant, Sherman, McPherson, "
"Howard, and Logan, in turn the commanders of the Army "
"of the Tennessee and four of them alive, Rawlins selection "
at that time is significant of the esteem in which he was 
held by the men who best knew him. His biography will 
reveal him as one of the strongest characters of his time. 

General Rawlins delivered the first annual address at 
"the meeting held at Cincinnati, November 7, 1866. These "
annual addresses became the chief feature of the meetings 
"of the society. In this address, or rather, oration, John A. "
Rawlins revealed what I have heard men of affairs say who 
"were his clients before the war, that he was one of the best "
"lawyers of his time. He had been a Douglas Democrat, "
a Douglas elector in 1860. He made a Union speech at 
"Galena after Sumter was fired on, and then enlisted. "

"Standing for ""an indestructible Union of indestructible "

"States,"" breathing charity and forgiveness and confessing "

that race prejudice common at the beginning of the war 

(which Abraham Lincoln had admitted when pressed to 

30



464 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"the wall in the Lincoln-Douglas debates in 1858, and the "
Southern leaders have so often quoted since the war). 
John A. Raw T lins came up to what in 1866 he considered 
the logic of events. 

You continued to fight on [after it became an Abolition war] 
until the enemy not only recognized the colored soldier when 
"captured, as entitled to be treated as a prisoner of war, but until "
"the rebel Congress, a Congress of slaveholders, notwithstanding "
the bitterness with which they had denounced the national govern 
"ment for the same act, passed a law authorizing the arming of "
negro slaves and putting them in the ranks side by side with the 
white soldiers of the Rebel army. Thus before the conflict ceased 
they stood elevated to the dignity of defenders of the flag they 
"were under, whether national or rebel, representing freedom or "
slavery. 

"That which was the subject race under the law, was the "
"equal of other races. Certainly ""life, liberty and the pursuit of "
"happiness"" as Jefferson wrote it, should be the lot of the freed- "
"man, if not ""greater privileges."" 1 "

"The idol of the volunteers, more intimate with and pos "
sessing more influence over General Grant than any man 
"with whom the latter ever came in contact, John A. Rawlins, "
"by reason of his intellect and legal training, was the most "
powerful man in the Republic from 1865 to 1869. Always 
"Rawlins friend, Walter Q. Gresham was one of the first "
to divine the end to which Rawlins and General Grant were 
"headed, namely, to universal suffrage for the freedman. "
Then it was that Frank P. Blair decamped. 

General Sherman succeeded General Rawlins as presi 
"dent of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee, and held "
"the office until his death. But for some reason, General "
Sherman did not attend the St. Paul meeting in 1877. It 
so happened that General Gresham was the senior vice- 
president present. He responded to the address of welcome 
at the State Fair and presided at the banquet which 
"concluded the proceedings. At this banquet, very much to "

1 See page 460. It was Rawlins who pulled Grant away from Lincoln s position of 
imited suffrage for the freedman. See also page 316 el seq. 



REUNIONS OF ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE 465 

"the great regret of the large majority of the members, some "
of the old-time bitterness eroppecl out. General Benjamin 
Spooner was assigned at the last minute to take the place 
"of a man who had failed to attend, to respond to the toast, "
Our Dead. In it General Spooner made an ugly but of 
"its kind a most deft attack on the mayor of St. Paul, who "
"was present as a guest of the society, because in his wel "
coming address the mayor had proposed the joint decoration 
"of the Union and Confederate dead. ""No man can go "
further than I in acknowledging the ability and valor of 
"the Rebel soldier,"" said General Spooner, as he held up the "
"left sleeve of his coat, minus his arm, ""but until the living "
"show a little more contrition, I am not yet ready to deco "
"rate their dead."" "

"At St. Paul, Indianapolis was selected as the place for "
"the next, the twelfth, annual meeting, and October 30 and "
"31, 1878, as the time. Meanwhile, General Sherman ap "
"pointed a committee on arrangements, of which he named "
Walter Q. Gresham as chairman. Included in its member 
"ship was General Benjamin Spooner. At the first meeting, "
"which was at a dinner at our house, my husband said, "
We must get some new speakers for our banquet. We 
"have all made speeches, some of us several times, and are "
talked out; we have right here in Indianapolis General 
Chapman of the Army of the Potomac and General Harrison 
of the Army of the Cumberland. Let us invite each to come 
"and respond to a toast."" This was agreed to. Up to that "
"time, ex-Senator and ex-Governor Thomas A. Hendricks, "
late a candidate for Vice-President on the ticket of Tilden 
"and Hendricks, had never attended a soldiers gathering of "
any kind. My husband s suggestion that Mr. Hendricks 
be invited to come to the banquet and respond to one of the 
"toasts, struck fire. All except the chairman were opposed "
"to it. One man said, ""I will never consent to invite a "
"Copperhead to one of our reunions."" Another said, ""It "
"is against our Constitution."" But General Sherman backed "



466 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

up his chairman with a letter that was practically a com 
"mand, and the invitation went and was accepted. 1 "

The reunion began with the routine business meeting at 
the Park Theatre in the morning and a public meeting in 
the same place in the evening. General Sherman presided 
and Colonel W. F. Vilas of Wisconsin delivered the annual 
address. Invitations at my husband s instance had been 
"extended to Governor Williams, Senator Joseph E. Mac Don "
"ald, ex-Governor Thomas A. Hendricks, and a number of "
"noncombatants, with General Benjamin Harrison at the "
head of the list of the soldier element who had served in 
other armies. They were all there. Colonel Vilas proved 
an orator worthy of that or any other occasion. After 
wards a member of President Cleveland s first cabinet and 
"a member of the United States Senate, he but once came up "
to the standard he then set. This was a year later at the 
annual meeting of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee 
"at Chicago. Democrat as he always was, Colonel Vilas did "
not believe Grant was whipped the first day at Shiloh. 

Who that loved his fellowmen did not rejoice in the institu 
tions of American liberty? Who that believed the great Creator 
"comprehended all men in his benevolence, not the special few, "
"did not pray for its perpetuity ? Above all, how could an American "
fail to love his country? or dare attempt to destroy it? But it 
is written that sin shall be visited even upon the third and fourth 
generation. And there was sin in the land. Out of it grew 
sectional division and hatred between countrymen. . . . But 
"First of all, soldiers of the Union were ready to clasp hands across "
"the bloody chasm. Better than others, they knew the valor and "
the worth of our brethern of the South. And right ready have 
"they ever been to rejoice in the restored brotherhood, and heartily "
"they pray that if ever again this nation shall have need of war, "
"shoulder to shoulder we shall oppose the common foe, and each "
"for the other, fight its common cause. "

At this Indianapolis meeting General Lew Wallace 
"applied for membership. ""Acknowledge your mistake at "

1 See page 469. 



REUNIONS OF ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE 467 

"Shiloh and we will forgive you,"" said General Granville B. "
"Dodge, ""and welcome you to full fellowship."" General "
"Wallace refused to acknowledge any error on his part, and "
"the incident was closed. Speaking of it afterwards, Gen "
"eral Dodge said, ""We would have gladly forgiven General "
"Wallace, but exonerate him we could not without reflect "
"ing on General Grant, and that we could not honestly do."" "
"Once within the circle, among the first to call on General "
"Sherman, when the latter put up at the Bates House, was "
Thomas A. Hendricks. By his natural geniality and charm 
of manner he won many men who until then had looked 
"on him only with aversion as an enemy to their country, "
"while he in turn was captivated by their oratory, the warmth "
"of greeting, and not least of all by ""Sherman s Bummers."" "
"Writing of ""Sherman s Bummers"" and that Indianapolis "
"meeting, George Harding, a newspaper man, said: ; The "
Herald does not know much about war and armies but 
when it comes to drinking champagne we will put the 
"Army of the Tennessee against the world."" At the banquet "
"General Sherman presided, and there never was a better "
presiding officer on such an occasion. Out of the eleven 
"toasts, but three were responded to by men from the "
"Army of the Tennessee. Generals Harrison and Chapman, "
"as the special representatives of their respective armies, the "
"Cumberland and the Potomac, spoke well. But the chief "
"interest centered in Thomas A. Hendricks, who in response "
"to the toast ""Indiana"" delivered in his best voice the best "
speech he ever made. Considering his opposition to the 
"prosecution of the war, his votes as United States Senator "
against even submitting the Thirteenth and Fourteenth 
"Amendments to the people for ratification, it deserves more "
than passing mention. 

"The Army of the Tennessee, in great battles and by many "
"deeds of individual heroism, made an imperishable record. It "
"was all to preserve our institutions, to maintain the integrity of "
"the Union. By every consideration of material interests, as well "



468 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"as by strong sentiments of patriotism, the people of Indiana arc "
held in powerful support of the legitimate results of the war. . . 

Perhaps I have already said too much in commendation of 
"Indiana, but I must be allowed to claim for her still another "
merit. She has a breast big enough and warm enough to appre 
"ciate the heroic achievements of the Army of the Tennessee, "
and of those other co-operating armies that have preserved to 
us a nation. 

Afterwards Governor Hendricks went to many of the 
"annual reunions of the Army of the Tennessee, and he "
always had a warm welcome. He would come home arid 
"talk about ""our boys and how they put down the Rebellion,"" "
"until his partner, Oscar B. Hord, a native of Kentucky, a "
"strong-headed man and a Secessionist, would, between "
"indignation and raillery, say, ""But, Governor, you did not "
"use to talk about my native land that way."" "

"Without any design, Chicago was selected as the place "
"of meeting in 1879, and my husband as the orator. At "
"noon, November 12, 1879, General Sherman adjourned the "
meeting and announced they would march to the depot 
"to meet General Grant ""on his return from his trip around "
"the world."" The annual address was delivered that even "
ing at Haverly s Theater. The stage was crowded and the 
"theater packed with distinguished men: Generals Grant, "
"Sherman, Sheridan, Logan, Pope, Hurlbut. Schofield, "
"Force, Hickenlooper, Auger, Oglesby, Harding, Macfeely, "
"Bingham, Raum, Alfonso Taft, ex-Secretary of War, and "
"men who had attained distinction in civil life, like Gover "
nor Beveridge and Governor Cullom. Newspaper men 
"there were by the score, and among them Henry Watterson. "

"At the banquet on the following evening, Colonel Wil "
"liam F. Vilas of Wisconsin, the orator of the year before, in "
"responding to the toast, ""Our First Commander, General "
"U. S. Grant,"" gained a national reputation in an address "
"that took only ten minutes to deliver, while Colonel R. G. "
"Ingersoll, the great infidel, and one of our best friends, in "



REUNIONS OF ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE 469 

"responding to the toast, ""The Volunteer Soldier of the "
"Union Army, whose valor and patriotism saved to the world "
"a government of the people, by the people, and for the "
"people,"" delivered an oration that will ever rank as an epic "
"in literature. As one newspaper said, the Army of the "
"Tennessee was composed of men who could talk, as well "
"as fight. The year before, at Indianapolis, the ice had been "
"broken. 1 S. L. Clemens (Mark Twain), an ex-Confederate, "
"responded to the toast, ""The Babies."" ""In that I was "
"once a baby,"" Mark claimed he resembled General Grant. "

Perhaps I have already quoted too much from the men 
"of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee, but I must do "
"so still further, for as one newspaper stated it, the position "
"of Judge Gresham, with General Grant coming back as a "
"candidate for President for the third time, was one of the "
most difficult and honorable ever filled by a citizen soldier. 
"There was due tribute to Grant and Sherman as soldiers, "
"with Grant first, as Sherman always wanted it. In the per "
"manent records of the Society, Colonel L. M. Dayton, "
"General Sherman s amanuensis, as he had been all through "
"the war, made this entry: : The society has been here "
"tofore exceedingly fortunate in the selection of orators, and "
"General Gresham fully maintains the record, ranking with "
"the ablest and the best."" "

"And what is not of record, the orator got back the "
"confidence of the old commander. In private, General "
Grant disclosed his regret at some of the things that had 
happened in his second administration which the orator 
deprecated. The General was also frank in his avowal that 
he would never be misled again. Convinced as he always 
"was of General Grant s sincerity, Walter Q. Gresham be "
came one of his supporters for the third term in 1880. 

The opening sentiment that the supremacy of the 
"States, which the South asserted and we denied, were sur "
rendered at Appomattox Henry Watterson criticized as 
"partisan, but fifteen years later it found indorsement in "

1 See page 466. 



470 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"the address of Senator John W. Daniels of Virginia, an "
"ex-Confederate, at the dedication of a monument to Gen "
eral Lee. 

A few lines will show Judge Gresham s consideration 
for the Southern brother. 

It is true that the Constitution was the result of mutual con 
"cession, that it did not fully express the views of either party or "
any one person. . . . There is this much incongruity in those 
"two theories of the Constitution, which, taken together, make us "
"at the same time a nation and a confederacy of nations, one "
sovereignty and thirty-eight sovereignties. Both of them can 
not be true; there is an irreconcilable antagonism between them; 
"one excludes the other. Sovereignty is supremacy, and in this "
sense it is one and indivisible; it is in the nation or it is in the 
State; it cannot be in both. 

Slavery was imbedded in the Constitution before any of 
"those who participated in the Rebellion were born, and it is to "
the credit of the enlightened and patriotic statesmen who framed 
"that instrument, that they acted on the confident belief that "
slavery would soon cease to exist. It is the part of statesman 
ship to accept the highest attainable good; and if the majority 
"of its framers, who certainly were sincere friends of popular "
"liberty, had obstinately refused to make any concessions to the "
"slave interest, the effort to form a more perfect union might "
"have proved futile and even disastrous. But, as it"" was, the "
Southern people were supported and confirmed in their opinion 
of slavery; they were also swayed by inherited ideas and preju 
"dices which were derived from a remote past, and are always "
potent in their influence. Their interests appeared to be in 
"conflict with their duty to the national government; and, under "
"all these circumstances, it would be ungenerous to assert that "
the war was wholly the act of conscious and deliberate wrong 
"doers. It is, moreover, undeniable that they displayed soldierly "
"qualities of the highest order, and that, although mistaken and "
"misguided in their purposes, they fought, as they believed, for a "
"righteous cause, and in a war that was inevitable. "

But it was with the future rather than with the past 
that Walter O. Gresham was concerned. 



REUNIONS OF ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE 471 

"Having conquered the Rebellion, we must now be satisfied "
with the peaceful sway of the laws. Military government in time 
of peace is contrary to the spirit of our institutions. 

"We must stand by the purpose for which we fought, and that "
was the maintenance of the government of our fathers. Citizens 
of the North and South sustain precisely the same relation to 
"that government, and it cannot lawfully do in one State what it "
has not an equal right to do in all the States. The war legislated; 
it established the supremacy of the nation in every power con 
"ferred on it by the Constitution, but it did not destroy the States, "
nor the right of local self-government. 

That the war did not destroy the States nor the right 
"of local self-government, Walter O. Gresham as a Federal "
judge ever maintained.

"AFTER the war and the passing of the Thirteenth, Four "
"teenth, and Fifteenth Amendments the Fifteenth "
"Amendment going into effect March 30, 1870, Congress, "
"on May 31, 1870, by what is called the ""Enforcement Acts/ "
imposed the same duties on State election officers at elec 
"tions at which Representatives in Congress were voted for, "
"in so far as these elections concerned members of Congress, "
that the State statutes imposed on the State election offi 
cers as to the election of State officers. This legislation 
also provided that the Federal judges might appoint United 
States marshals and inspectors to be at the polls and see 
that the State officers did their duty as far as the election 
of Congressmen was concerned. These acts were designedly 
passed to secure the ballot to the freedmen in the Southern 
"States. In the Kentucky election in 1878 Blanton Duncan, "
"an ex-Confederate, wanted to go to Congress as an Inde "
pendent Democrat from the Louisville District. To seare 
off the regular Democrats and the Democratic organiza 
"tion, Mr. Duncan threatened all, especially the Kentucky "
"State officers, in the event of the ballot boxes being stuffed "
"against him or of his being counted out, with the pains and "
penalties of the Enforcement Acts. The election developed 
that Mr. Duncan had no cause to complain of the Kentucky 



ELECTION FRAUD CASES 473 

"election officers, but his exposition of the law was so clear "
that after the elections in October and November of that 
"year, the National government began the prosecution of a "
large number of State election officers in Cincinnati and 
Baltimore and a number of the citizens of Jennings and 
"Jackson counties, Indiana, the latter before Judge Gresham. "

The indictment in the Jennings County cases in three 
counts was drawn under the general conspiracy statute of 
"the United States, Section 5440, which made it a felony "
for two or more persons to conspire to commit an offense 
against the United States. The section of the statute that 
it was charged it was intended to violate was Section 
"5511- of the Enforcement Act, which made it a felony to "
vote at a place at which one was not lawfully entitled to 
"vote, or to aid, counsel, or advise any such votes, or person "
or officer to do any act thereby made a crime. It was also 
made an offense against the United States for a State elec 
tion officer to violate any State statute in so far as it might 
affect the election of a member of Congress. 

The government was represented by Colonel Nelson 
"Trussler, his assistant, Major C. L. Holstein, and by General "
"Benjamin Harrison and his partner, William H. H. Miller, "
as special counsel. The defendants were represented by ex- 
"Governor Thomas A. Hendricks, David Turpie, A. W. Hen- "
"dricks, and Jason Brown "

Elaborate arguments for two days were made on the 
"motion to quash the indictments, but all three counts were "
finally sustained. 

"When, on May 8, 1879, the jury was called to the box, "
"it consisted of seven Republicans, four Democrats, and one "
"Independent. General W. W. Dudley, the United States "
"marshal, afterwards famous as the author of the ""Blocks "
"of Five"" letters, had summoned the jury. General Har "
rison was then the chief leader in the Indiana Republican 
organization. General Dudley was also prominent as a 
"manager of the affairs of the party, and in his political "

1 Now Section 37 of Criminal Code. - Repealed. 



474 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

capacity had caused a large number of the practical workers 
of the Republican organization of Indianapolis to assemble 
in the courtroom. Two of the Democrats were challenged 
"by General Harrison, and their places were filled by Repub "
licans called by General Dudley from the bystanders. The 
"defense then challenged three Republicans, and in their "
"places General Dudley called three other Republicans, "
"more partisan, the defense claimed, than those displaced. "
"Colonel A. W. Hendricks said, ""It is evidently the purpose "
"of the government, should the regular panel be exhausted, "
for Colonel Dudley to make up the jury from partisan 
"Republican bystanders in the courtroom."" At the ad "
"journment for the day, the jury stood nine Republicans, "
"two Democrats, and one Independent. "

"The next morning, at the opening of court, Governor "
"Hendricks, after reverting to the political complexion of "
"the jury and the political character of the case, said : "

After consultation with the gentlemen associated with me in 
"the defense of this case, I say to the court, considering the case "
"as it is and the political relations of the defendants, that I do not "
"think we ought to be compelled to try this case before this jury, "
and I ask Your Honor to order a new jury to be called which shall 
be more evenly divided. 

General Harrison replied: 

"If Your Honor please, I think I never before heard in any "
"court a request of the kind just made by Governor Hendricks, "
"viz., challenging the competency of a juror because he belongs "
to one or the other of the political parties. In some of Governor 
Hendricks interrogatories to the jury he seemed to assume that 
this question involved political feeling and was an issue between 
the parties. In answer to that and in answer to what he has just 
"said here, which is substantially a challenge to the array of jurors "
"because more than half of them are Republicans, I wish to say "
"that this is an extraordinary and unusual challenge, not supported "
"by any law found in the books or in the practice of any court, so "
far as I know. 



ELECTION FRAUD CASES 475 

"After further argument, the eourt said: "

Of course the presumption of the law is that no man goes 
"into a jury box remembering his politics, and yet sometimes they "
do; and it is of the utmost importance in a trial of this kind that 
the defendants should feel that they have an impartial trial. 
"Before taking the step which I have concluded to take, I think "
it due to the jury to say that the court has no reason to believe 
that any juryman here has any desire to do anything other than 
his duty as a juryman. But it is of the utmost importance in a 
trial of this character that there should be no ground of complaint 
"whichever way the trial may result, and I will order a special "
"venire sent out, returnable tomorrow morning. I know it is a "
"very unusual thing to do, but I think at common law the court "
may do it when it is satisfied the interests of justice require it. 
I think a judge should not hesitate to exercise any authority 
belonging to his office in the interests of justice. This is a case 
likely to excite prejudice. I do not say it would have that effect 
"with this jury, but the defendants are arraigned here under a "
"grave charge, and men, under such circumstances, are naturally "
apprehensive. I think this question is in the discretion of the 
"court, but should be exercised only in extraordinary cases. I do "
not want any one to have ground for feeling that there is cause 
for complaint when this trial is over. And as I think that the 
"defendants might naturally feel as they do, I will order a venire "
"of twenty-two men, whose names will be given in the venire to "
appear here to-morrow morning. 

In its report of the day s proceedings the Indianapolis 
"Sentinel, the Democratic organ said: "

"General Harrison, his partner, Mr. Miller, the assistant dis "
"trict attorney, Major Holstein, and Judge Martindalc, the "
"proprietor of the Indianapolis Journal, the Republican organ, "
"privately vented their indignation at the action of the court, "
"which, the Sentinel said, was that of a fearless judge. "

"Mr. W. H. H. Miller, General Harrison s partner and "
"associate in this prosecution, said then and afterwards in "
"the Coy case, which will be duly elaborated for it is part "
"of our judicial history, that ""it is impossible to convict "



476 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"a Democrat in Judge Gresham s court."" But William H. "
"H. Miller, as Attorney-General of the United States in "
"President Harrison s cabinet, lost his zeal when it came to "
prosecuting Republicans for violating the election laws. 

"From the twenty-two men, among the best known "
"citizens of Indianapolis, summoned by the special venire, "
"twelve, six Republicans and six Democrats, were sworn to "
"try the cases. They were A. Abromet, L. S. Ayres, Samuel "
"Beck, S. T. Bowen, W. T. Christian, Marius Eddy, C. A. "
"Ferguson, Phillip Gapen, W. J. Holliday, A. G. Pettibone, "
"Joseph Stout, and James C. Yohn. "

The charge of the government as set forth in the opening 
statement of General Harrison to the jury was that James 
"Wilkinson, the Democratic candidate for treasurer in Jen "
"nings County; William Brashier, a citizen of that county; "
and twelve other citizens of Jennings and Jackson count 
"ies, including Samuel Johnson, the mayor of Seymour, all "
"Democrats, conspired contrary to the statutes of the "
United States and the State of Indiana to import into 
the Fourth Congressional District of Indiana 125 men not 
"residents of that congressional district, for the purpose of "
"voting in Jennings County, a part of the Fourth Congres "
"sional district, for the Congressman to be elected on the 8th "
"day of October, 1878, at which Leonidas Sexton was the "
Republican candidate and Jepha D. New was the Demo 
"cratic candidate; that Thomas McGovern, a private de "
"tective living in Seymour, discovered the conspiracy as "
"stated on the 8th day of September, and reported its exis "
"tence to one Peter Platter and other Republican leaders, "
who in turn advised McGovern to join the conspirators or 
"defendants, get their confidence, and expose their illegal "
"acts. For his services McGovern was to be, and was, paid "
the sum of $400. 

Governor Hendricks made the opening statement for 
"the defense. James Wilkinson, he said, was a clean, active "
young man who was making great inroads on the Republican 



ELECTION FRAUD CASES 477 

majority of 400 in Jennings County; that the 125 men whose 
"right to vote in Jennings County the government questioned, "
had gone there to work and for permanent residence; that 
"Peter Platter and David Overmeyer, the brother of John "
"Overmeyer, the chairman of the Republican State Central "
Committee and the Republican candidate for representative 
"to the legislature from Jennings County, political adver "
"saries of the defendants, conspired with McGovern to in "
volve the defendants in the appearance of being engaged in 
the fraudulent importation of voters into Jennings County. 
That in pursuance of this conspiracy and for the money 
"paid and to be paid by Platter, Overmeyer, the chairman "
"of the Republican State Central Committee, and the chair "
"men of the Jennings and Jackson County Committees, "
McGovern made the proposition to the defendants to im 
"port the voters, which they declined. Then the defendants "
said that McGovern went ahead and imported a number of 
"men from Jackson County to vote in Jennings County, "
and on the eve of the election made an affidavit which was 
printed in a handbill and sent broadcast throughout Jen 
"nings County, that James Wilkinson and others were im "
porting voters into the Fourth Congressional District. It 
was charged then and admitted later in the trial that the 
$400 which was to be paid and was paid by the political 
"committees to McGovern, was agreed to be paid at a meet "
ing which General Harrison and State Chairman Overmeyer 
"attended at North Vernon, the county seat of Jennings "
"County, \vhile on a campaign tour in September, 1878. "

With one hundred witnesses on a side and thirty in re 
"buttal, the evidence was not closed until May 30. In "
"pressing the defense, the defendants counsel were ag "
gressive and merciless. They established the fact that 
McGovern was a man without character and unworthy of 
belief. For several days General Harrison was absent from 
the trial by reason of sickness. Colonel A. W. Hendricks 
was the architect or the lawyer of the defense. His plan 



478 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"was, having broken down the case of the government "
"and discredited everybody connected with the prosecution, "
"not to put a single defendant on the witness stand. ""Be "
"sides,"" said the colonel, ""an administration whose title "
rests in fraud [referring to the Hayes-Tilden contest] is 
not in a position to ask the conviction of men who stand 
"innocent before the law. 1 But Governor Hendricks zeal, "
"enthusiasm, and confidence overruled his associate, and "
James Wilkinson was put on the witness stand in his own 
behalf. He speedily went to pieces under General Har 
rison s cross-examination. He was the only man who went 
"on the witness stand, and he alone was convicted. ""Had "
"Wilkinson kept off the witness stand,"" said A. G. Pettibone, "
"one of the Republican members of the jury, years after "
"ward to me in Chicago, ""he would have escaped conviction."" "

General Dudley up to this time had been a frequent 
visitor at our home. He had a fine record as a soldier and 
"had lost a leg at Gettysburg. A handsome man, a thorough "
"gentleman, upright in all his business and professional re "
"lations, in politics he believed the end justified the means. "
"Never eminent in his profession, he saw in that Jennings "
County trial the force of Colonel A. W. Hendricks defense 
and he later applied it to the prosecution that was insti 
"tuted against him in 1888 because of his famous, or in "
"famous, ""Blocks of Five"" letters. "

District Attorney Trussler opened the Jennings County 
case to the jury. David Turpie and Governor Hendricks 
"followed for the defense, and General Harrison closed the "
case for the government. Governor Hendricks spoke a 
day and a half and General Harrison two days. 

"There \vas no registration law in Indiana at that time, "
and the only qualification for a voter w r as that he be twenty- 
"one years of age, a resident of the State six months pre "
"ceding the day of the election, and no limitation as to the "
time within which he might change his residence from one 
precinct to another. All the law required was that there 



ELECTION FRAUD CASES 479 

"be a bona fide change of residence, if only on the day before "
the election. David Turpie was able to argue that he might 
lawfully vote at any one of the three precincts in Indian 
"apolis, so indefinite was the law. General Harrison was "
pressed hard for acting in such a case at the behest of a 
political party. And so fierce was the denunciation of Mc- 
"Govern, the detective, that General Harrison wisely dis "
"claimed him, asked the jury entirely to disregard his testi "
"mony, and was able, with the aid of the court, to make "
out his case from the testimony of other witnesses and the 
"one defendant, James Wilkinson, who went on the stand "
in his own behalf. 

"In opening his argument, General Harrison emphasized "
"the fact that he was a sw r orn officer of the government, and "
that he was not a partisan. He said: 

I should despise with unutterable loathing that political 
sympathizer who should give one whit more attention to what 
"I say, or any greater weight to my argument, because we are of "
the same political party ; and I should despise myself if I thought 
that I brought to the trial of this case a single taint or impulse 
"from the field of politics. And equally, Gentlemen of the Jury, "
should I despise with unutterable loathing that political opponent 
who should put an additional barrier in the way of the approach 
of my argument to his conscience and intellect because he was my 
political opponent. Politics must not enter here. They may be 
low or high. The distinguished gentleman who first addressed 
you for the defense repudiated the idea that politics were low. 
. . . It will indeed he a sad day for our country when so much 
as a spray from those waves of politics which roll so tumultuously 
"over the land, can be felt in the face of a jury or judge. "

"In reply to Governor Hendricks, he said : "

It is not necessary that there be a meeting of the conspirators 
at all. Men have been convicted of a conspiracy who have never 
"looked each other in the face, who have never spoken or written "
one word to each other. The question is this : Have they by word 
or act made themselves parties to the common design? If they 
31



480 LIFE OF WALTER QUINT IN ORE SHAM 

"have, then they are co-conspirators for the accomplishment of "
"it. There need not be a word or a wink, but only that they act "
together to accomplish the unlawful purpose. This partnership 
in crime is curious in its character. If a new partner comes in 
"just when the crime is being consummated, at the climax of the "
"enterprise, he becomes a partner from the beginning, and is en "
titled to share in all the odium and punishment that belonged to 
the originator of the enterprise. 

"I say again, and I ask His Honor to charge you, that it is "
not necessary to the crime of conspiracy that a single illegal 
vote should have been cast. 

The court so instructed. 

"The crime here charged is an exceedingly grave one, "
"graver, it seems to me, than an offense against life or property; "
"more unsettling of all human rights, more disturbing to the peace "
"of society, than any crime that can be committed. I know many "
men are more shocked when some crime against the person or 
"against property is committed, but, gentlemen, the security of "
our persons and our property is in the law and in the adminis 
tration of it by the courts. vSo that any combination or conspir 
acy that tends to corrupt the ballot box and return by fraud and 
"artifice men to the legislature who are not properly elected, or "
"to the bench to discharge judicial functions, men who are not the "
"choice of the majority of the people, strikes at the very founda "
tions of our government and the peace of society. Is that class 
of crime a political crime? Is it possible that such a case as this 
is a political case? 

The General then quoted Governor Hendricks to the 
Indiana legislature: 

Our present election laws are not very efficient to prevent 
"fraud. But if they are inefficient, if they give facilities to fraud "
"when construed as courts have construed them, the construction "
which has here been given to them by the counsel for the defense 
scandalizes even these loose election laws we have in Indiana. 

"Then he discussed the evidence, concluding: "

"Now, Gentlemen, the only other question is, and I recur a "
"little to what I said in the opening, do you believe these men that "



ELECTION FRAUD CASES 481 

were brought into Jennings County were to stay there and make 
their permanent residence in that county? [Messrs. Turpie and 
Hendricks had argued the changes of residence from Jackson to 
Jennings County we re in good faith.] You have heard what 
"Johnson, Holmes, and their Democratic and personal friends "
have said these men did. Can you justify it? If it be said a 
jury of twelve men chosen for their intelligence and high character 
"in the city of Indianapolis, justify such conduct in politics, then "
"I say, repeal every criminal law on the subject of elections; pro "
claim it to the world that all our young men are loose young 
"men; let inoncv with its corrupt influence be used, and let them "
be herded from county to county whenever their votes may be 
needed to carry any particular election. 

"In conclusion, allow me to speak to some of you again in "
regard to the high plane of duty to which your oath calls you. I 
"do not wish you to feel I doubt you, that I doubt your disposition "
and willingness to come up to the full summit of your duty. 
Let each one turn his eyes inward. Let him search his heart as 
"with a lighted candle, and see if there be any loathsome prejudice "
or bias hidden in its darkest recesses for or against the defendants. 
As the Saviour of man when He came to the earth and found that 
"temple on which it had been written, ""It shall be called by all "
"nations the home of prayer,"" had become a den of thieves, and "
as He came into the temple arid made a whip of cords and drove 
the money-changers and them that sold oxen and doves out of 
"the holy place of prayer, saying to them with withering scorn, "
"Take these things hence, so let every juror I speak to, drive out "
every unholy bias or prejudice that might creep into the pure 
sanctuary of his heart. 

After adverting to the indefiniteness of the Indiana 
"statutes on the question of residence, which was favorable "
"to the defense, the court s instructions concluded: "

This is not a political trial. The defendants are charged 
with the commission of a crime; although it is claimed that the 
offense was committed in the interests of a certain political organ 
"ization, yet they are to be tried just as if indicted for any other "
offense. 

Whatever feeling or prejudice may have been exhibited by 



482 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN ORE SHAM 

"others during the progress of the trial, the jury, in the discharge "
"of their solemn duty, should allow no political nor other improper "
considerations to influence them. 

"If the defendants are not guilty on the evidence, party pre "
judice should not prevent the prompt return of a verdict in their 
"favor; and if, on the other hand, the evidence clearly shows "
"them guilty, such prejudice should not delay a verdict against "
them. 

He who deliberately plans a fraud to defeat a fair and honest 
"expression of the popular will through the ballot box, and actually "
"enters upon its execution, commits a grave crime against popular "
"government, and good men of all parties will condemn his con "
duct and rejoice in his punishment when his guilt has been satis 
factorily established. You will carefully examine the evidence 
"with reference to each of the defendants, and convict or acquit "
"each as the proofs may require. Your verdict may, therefore, "
"be a conviction of all, an acquittal of all, a conviction of two or "
"more of those on trial, and an acquittal of the balance, or a con "
"viction of any one on trial, if he is found to be guilty with any "
"defendant not on trial, and an acquittal of the balance. Should you "
"find any or all of the defendants guilty, it will be the duty of the "
court to fix the punishment. With this you have nothing to do. 

"Having thus sustained the General when hard pressed, "
Judge Gresham thought that Harrison should ever after 
wards live up to the high standard of political morality 
they then agreed to. 

"But one man was found guilty, James Wilkinson, of "
"conspiring with William Brashier, who, although indicted, "
was not on trial. He had absconded. Twelve were ac 
"quitted. But as to Henry Warpe and Calvin Wilder, the "
jury failed to agree and they continued at liberty under the 
bonds they had previously given. The Democratic leaders 
in Jennings and Jackson counties then indicted McGovern 
and a number of government witnesses for perjury. One 
was convicted in Jennings County and sent to prison. 
Then there was a compromise and the indictments in both 
State and Federal courts were nolled. 



ELECTION FRAUD CASES 483 

Wilkinson was sentenced to twelve months in the State 
"Prison at Jefferson ville, Indiana, at hard labor. The judge "
said in passing sentence : 

"The trial was protracted and fair, and the court is now called "
"on to pass sentence. If the principle of governing by majority, "
"under proper limitations, is to be maintained, the elective franchise "
must be sacredly guarded; unscrupulous tricksters who conspire 
to prevent a fair and honest expression of the popular will through 
the ballot box should be punished with a severity that will deter 
others from committing similar offenses. 

"The Sentinel, the Democratic State organ, said: ""The "
principles Judge Gresham announced would send thousands 
"of Republicans to the penitentiary."" Mild criticism for "
the partisanship of that day! But the trial had not been 
"conducted so that there was ""no ground for complaint,"" "
and there was none. No attempt was made to take Wil 
kinson s case to the Supreme Court. Governor Hendricks 
acquiesced with his partners in the constitutionality of the 
Enforcement Acts. 

But the prosecutions begun at the same time in Balti 
"more and Cincinnati, which resulted in convictions, were "
"taken to the Supreme Court, where the Enforcement Acts "
and the power of Congress to impose duties on State elec 
"tion officers, in so far as their duties related to the election "
"of a member of Congress, were sustained. 1 Justice Field "
"and Justice Clifford, the Democratic members of the "
"court, dissented, following the Prigg case in holding that "
all Federal powers must be exercised by officers of the 
"Federal government. As the mouthpiece of the court, "
Justice Bradley in the Clark case used this language: 

In what we have said it must be remembered that we are 
dealing only with the subject of elections of Representatives to 
"Congress. We do not mean to say, however, that for any acts of "
"the officers of the election, having exclusive reference to the "
"election of State or county officers, they will be amenable to "

1 Ex-parte Siebold 100 U. S. 371 and ex-parte Clark 100 U. S. 399. 



484 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

Federal jurisdiction. Xor do we understand that the enactments 
of Congress now under consideration have any application to 
such acts. 

"In other words, as the soldier-judge and orator had put "
"it, ""while the ""a-ar legislated,"" it did not destroy the States, or "
the right of local self-government. But in maintaining these 
"propositions, or the explicit language of Justice Bradley, "
"Judge Gresham, as United States Circuit Judge for the "
"Seventh Circuit in 1884, in the Mackin case, brought on "
"himself much criticism, and in 1887, in the Coy case, he "
differed with General Benjamin Harrison and his law part 
"ner, William H. H. Miller, with William A. Woods, the "
"district judge at Indianapolis, with Justice John M. Harlan, "
and with the Supreme Court of the United States. 

"It is not common sense, said Justice Miller, speaking "
"for the Supreme Court of the United States in the Coy case, "
with Justice Field dissenting because the court was going 
beyond the Cincinnati and Baltimore cases or the Siebold 
"and Clark cases, ""for the States to punish offenses which "
"relate, solely to the State officers and for the government of "
the United States to punish offenses which relate solely to 
"the election of members of Congress."" "

Then Justice Miller broadened the scope of Federal juris 
diction. Any violation of any provision of a State statute 
"expressed or implied, although related exclusively to the "
election of a State officer at which a member of Congress 
"w r as voted for, was a crime punishable in the Federal courts. "

Coy s crime consisted in forging the election returns 
"relating to the election of a criminal judge in Marion County, "
"Indiana, on the 2d day of November, 1886. He had no "
"purpose, intent, or desire to effect the election of the Con "
gressman. He w r as the chairman of the Marion County 
Democratic Committee that year. 

"Born in Greensburgh, Indiana, in 1851, Simeon Coy "
had had but little education. In 1803 he went to Indian 
apolis. In 1872 he was elected a member of the Marion 



ELECTION FRAUD CASES 485 

"County Democratic Committee, and in 1881 a member of "
"the City Council, where, it was said, he was always on the "
side of the gas and transportation companies. In 1884 he 
was elected chairman of the Democratic County Committee 
over the protest of the better element of the party. A 
"pleasant, affable man, with much shrewdness, the election "
returns demonstrated his remarkable genius for organiza 
tion. He dominated conventions and nominated candi 
dates. Meanwhile he ran a saloon and was compliant in 
becoming bondsman for men accused of crime. Six months 
"before the 1886 election, Coy became one of the bondsmen "
"in the penalty of $4,000 for two notorious crooks who were "
"arrested and indicted for ""bunko steering."" They failed to "
appear for trial and there was a judgment of forfeiture. 
"Coy s purpose, among others, was to have the indictment "
held insufficient on the motion in arrest and thus relieve 
"him from paying the $4,000. His co-surety was insolvent. "

"In a habeas corpus proceeding, Judge Gresham, in the "
"face of much pressure and subsequent criticism, held Coy "
and his associates could not be prosecuted in the Federal 
court for forging the election returns so as to defeat the 
Republican and elect the Democratic candidate for criminal 
judge. 

"Then, under an indictment drawn by Judge Woods him "
"self and sustained by Justice Harlan and the Supreme Court, "
Coy was convicted and sentenced to the penitentiary. The 
gist of the charge against Coy and his associates was that 
they had conspired to induce certain election inspectors 
and custodians of the election returns to part for a short 
time with the physical possession of the certificates and tally 
"sheets, while the law, the Indiana statute, did not require, "
"command, or even suggest that the inspector keep these "
documents in his actual physical possession from the time 
he received them from the Election Board until he delivered 
"them to the Canvassing Board. The implication, Judge "
"Woods and Justice Harlan argued in their opinions, was "



486 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

that the legislature meant that the inspector should keep 
the unsealed certificate or tally sheet in his actual physical 
possession until he delivered it to the county clerk. This 
was too much of a refinement for even the Supreme Court 
"of the United States, so it broadened the Federal jurisdiction "
as we have heretofore stated. 

When it came to prosecuting Republicans in the 
"Blocks of Five cases in 1889, President Harrison, "
"Attorney-General Miller, Judge Woods, and Justice Har- "
lan turned back on what they had established as the law 
"in the Coy case. Senator Quay of Pennsylvania, a possi "
"ble defendant in the ""Blocks of Five"" cases, who used "
"his official and political power to arrest their prosecution, "
said Gresham s theory of the law was correct. Aside from 
the fact that the purpose or interest was different in the 
"Blocks of Five cases, that is, to affect a National and "
not a State election one thing Judge Gresham did not 
do which some of his critics claimed he ought to have 
done he did not lend a hand in getting these cases out 
of court. 

"Another thing Judge Gresham did not do, for which "
"General Dudley, at least, was very grateful, he did not "
use the principles established by the Supreme Court. in the 
"Coy case as a means, as he might have done, to push the "
prosecutions against Dudley or even General Harrison 
"himself, because the facts were conclusive that General "
Harrison was cognizant of everything that was done by 
Dudley and his co-conspirators in carrying the election of 
1888

This will more fully appear when we come to the Dudley 
Blocks of Five letters and again in 1893 when the Demo 
crats repealed practically all of the Enforcement Acts. 

"Joseph C. Mackin ""Chesterfield,"" as he was called - "
and Thomas Gallagher induced the county clerk of Cook 
"County, Illinois, to permit them to have access to the elec "
"tion returns for the election held November 4, 1884, before "



ELECTION FRAUD CASES 487 

these returns had been canvassed by the Canvassing Board. 
Mackin and Gallagher then changed the certificate in a 
"certain precinct, showing that Henry W. Leman had 220 "
"votes instead of 420 votes, and that Rudolph Brand had "
470 instead of 270 votes for the office of State senator. 
"They also substituted, in place of the ballots actually voted, "
ballots which they had had printed and the same as the 
"ballots actually voted, except the changes as to State sena "
tor. The ballots as printed and substituted for those voted 
"gave Brand 470 and Leman 220, and thus conformed with "
the forged certificate. Leman was a Republican and Brand 
a Democrat. Brand s election would make the Illinois leg 
"islature Democratic on joint ballot, would insure the defeat "
of Senator Logan s reelection and the election of a Demo 
"cratic senator, and would make the United States Senate "
Democratic. The discovery of the forgery saved Leman his 
seat and assured Senator Logan s reelection to the Senate. 

A citizens committee was organized and employed coun 
sel to aid in the prosecution of Mackin and Gallagher and 
"their co-conspirators. Instead of being indicted, they were "
"proceeded against ""by information,"" a mere affirmation "
under the oath of the district attorney that the defendants 
had conspired to commit offenses as described in violation 
of certain sections of the statutes of the United States al 
ready referred to as the Enforcement Acts. They w^ere tried 
"before Judge Blodgett and a jury, convicted and sentenced "
"to two years in the penitentiary at Joliet, and to pay a fine "
"of $5,000 each. On a petition for a writ of habeas corpus "
"and stay of sentence, Judge Gresham issued the writ and "
stayed the sentence until he and Judge Harlan could 
hear the case together. They certified it to the Supreme 
Court. 

The Supreme Court did not pass on the question as to 
"whether the Federal courts had jurisdiction, where it af "
firmatively appeared that the offense was designed only to 
affect the election of a State officer and not a member of 



488 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

Congress. But it decided that Mackin and Gallagher 
"could only be proceeded against, if at all, in a Federal court, "
by way of indictment by a grand jury; that the initial pro 
"ceeding by way of ""information"" was void because in con "
flict with the amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States. So the question was settled for all time in the Fed 
eral courts that before a defendant can be put to trial 
for a felony he must be indicted by a grand jury. 

Before the case was heard before Judge Gresham and 
"Judge Harlan, Judge Gresham was subjected to much criti "
cism as a judge who was imposing technicalities in behalf of 
men who had committed crimes against the elective fran 
chise. Many threatening letters were received. One let 
"ter, how r ever, came from Judge Davis, saying : I told the "
lawyers I talked to that if I had been on the bench I would 
"have decided the same way you did in the Mackin case."" "

Pending the appeal to the Supreme Court of the United 
"States, Mackin was indicted for forgery in the Criminal "
"Court of Cook County, Illinois, was subsequently tried and "
"convicted, and served his term in the penitentiary, "

At the 1880 election Judge Gresham divided the special 
United States marshals and supervisors between the Demo 
"crats and Republicans, although the latter made the ap "
"plication for their appointment, and up to that time the "
Federal judges had appointed only Republicans to these 
positions. 

Judge Gresham declined to become the Republican can 
didate for Governor of Indiana that year. He contem 
"plated becoming candidate for United States Senator, but "
reconsidered the question and declined.

repeal of the Bankruptcy Act of 1867 took effect in

district judge because there were throngs who wanted to 
clean up and begin anew. With the bankruptcy dockets 
"cleared and ahead of the chancery and law calendars, Wal "
"ter Q. Gresham had arranged, in 1882, to retire from the "
bench and go into partnership with Joseph E. MacDonald. 
"While he was holding his last term of court at Evansville, "
"President Arthur, without any solicitation on his part and "
"even without his knowing that he w T as being considered, "
offered him a place in the cabinet as Postmaster-General. 

The public and the press received the appointment with 
great cordiality. It was said that a number of gentlemen 
were responsible for the President s having made the ap 
"pointment, but it proved so popular that Mr. Arthur finally "
announced that he was himself the father of the idea. 

It so happened that just at that time Colonel John W. 
"Foster, who was then living and practicing law in Washing "
"ton, was appointed minister to Spain. It was arranged to "
the satisfaction of all that we should take the Foster house 
at 1405 I Street.

490 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"Congress was not in session and the season was over, "
"but Washington is charming out of season, especially in "
April and May. General Sherman s house was just around 
"the corner on Fifteenth Street, and he was as neighborly "
"as a village friend. The wife of his next-door neighbor, "
"General Henry W. Slocum, a member of Congress from "
"New York, was to become one of my best friends, also "
Mrs. John G. Carlisle of Kentucky. Both were women of 
"ability who had then seen much of affairs, and continued "
to do so. Another agreeable woman living on I Street was 
"Mrs. White, the daughter of Senator Philetus Sawyer of "
Wisconsin. Senator John Sherman lived a short distance 
away on H Street. I saw much of Mr. and Mrs. Sherman. 
Secretary of the Navy W. E. Chandler lived in the same 
"block. He almost lived with us that spring and summer, "
as Mrs. Chandler was away. Chief Justice Waite was our 
next-door neighbor. Justice and Mrs. Samuel Blatchford 
also lived in the same block on the corner of H and i?th 
streets. Former Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCul- 
"loch, whose retirement of the greenbacks my husband had "
"believed in, lived close by on McPherson Square, and was a "
frequent visitor. He talked finance and seemed to have the 
fiscal affairs of the government at his tongue s end. 

Among the men who took a fancy to my husband was 
"Justin S. Morrill, author of the Morrill tariff and then a "
senator from Vermont. The Merrills lived but two blocks 
"away on Vermont Avenue. Senator Merrill s sister, Miss "
"Swan, the finest type of the New England woman, who "
"greatly admired my husband s character, manifested an "
interest and friendship that still puts a glow to my heart. 
"General Schenck, the man who taught the Englishman the "
"great American game, was then living in Washington. At "
"his home, at the White House where President Arthur "
from the start took up with and was on good terms with the 
"Southern men at ""Chamberlain s"" and at ""Welker s,"" "
the soldier element of the sections sat over the green cloth 



IN PRESIDENT ARTHURS CABINET 491 

sometimes until very late hours later than Miss Swan 
"approved. Chamberlain s"" was less than a block from "
"our house. There Henry Watterson, or ""Marse Henry,"" "
put up when he came to town. 

"The one-legged Confederate, M. B. Butler, Senator from "
"South Carolina, was in that inner circle; also Senators Vest "
"and Pettit and the ex-Confederate Senator Mahone, who "
had organized a party of his own in Virginia. When 
Matthew Stanley Quay came to town as United States 
"Senator it was ""Marse Henry"" who said: ""Mat, here s "
"your chair!"" From the House there was "" Private John"" "
"M. Allen of Tupelo, the one-legged ""Dave"" Henderson, "
"General Henderson of Iow T a, and ""Tom"" Reed, each after "
wards Speaker. In everything but preserving the outward 
"semblance of party divisions, there was a friendship that "
obliterated party lines. 

"Our old pastor, Rev. William A. Bartlett, of the Second "
"Presbyterian Church of Indianapolis, was in Washington as "
the pastor of the New York Avenue Church. My daughter 
and I attended that church. Justice Harlan was a member 
"there, and it at once seemed to become the custom for him "
to stop in at our house Sunday mornings on the way home 
"from church. Judge Harlan was a good story-teller, with "
"a strong, resonant voice. He was much interested in my "
husband s efforts to exclude the Louisiana lottery from 
the mails. 

The Congress of 1872 had passed acts against the use of 
"the mails in furtherance of schemes to defraud, and to sup "
press lotteries. Section 4041 of the Revised Statutes au 
"thorized the Postmaster-General, upon any evidence satis "
"factory to him, to forbid the payment of any money order "
"in favor of, or drawn to the order of, any firm conducting a "
"lottery, and Section 3929 authorized its return to the sender "
"with the word ""fraudulent"" stamped on it. The payment "
"of money orders was stopped, but the lottery company then "
wrote its patrons to remit by express. Section 3894 1 follows: 

1 Since amended and now 213 of Criminal Code. 



492 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"No letter or circular concerning illegal lotteries, so-called "
"gift concerns, or other similar enterprises, offering prizes, or "
concerning schemes devised and intended to deceive and defraud 
the public for the purpose of obtaining money under false pre 
"tenses, shall be carried in the mail. Anybody who shall know "
ingly deposit or send anything to be conveyed by mail in violation 
of this section shall be punishable by a fine of not more than 
8500 nor less than Sio with costs of prosecution. 

Justice Harlan agreed with my husband that this sec 
tion was sufficient authority to warrant the Postmaster- 
General in excluding the lottery company s letters from 
"the mail. Accordingly, the Postmaster-General ordered "
the postmaster at New Orleans to refuse to deliver to the 
"Louisiana Lottery Company, and to the First National "
"Bank, the agent of the Lottery Company at New Orleans, "
"any mail, and to refuse to accept mail when he knew it came "
from these parties. 

Judge Billings promptly issued a mandatory injunction 
on the postmaster at New Orleans to deliver and receive 
the lottery mail. Then Mr. Gresham requested the Attor 
"ney-General to secure the dissolution of the injunction, but "
made no suggestion as to how the case should be man 
aged. The motion to dissolve was heard on a Saturday 
and was refused. I remember that Justice Harlan on the 
following Sunday morning was more provoked than my 
"husband at Judge Billings action. Indeed, the Justice was "
so wrought up that morning that the discussion was still 
on when the people were returning from church. This 
gave the Postmaster-General occasion to remind the 
"Justice that even on a Sunday, in helping to prosecute a "
"lottery company, he should not forget infant damnation "
and that Calvanistic confession of faith. Justice Harlan 
"said that William A. Morey, the associate attorney-general, "
had not managed the case right. Walter Q. Gresham said 
"the idea of a court, in the face of a general statute, attempt "
ing to control the discretion of one of the departments of 



IN PRESIDENT ARTHURS CABINET 493 

"the executive branch of the government, was preposterous. "
Not for a minute should a court of equity listen to such an 
application as the lottery people had made to Billings. 

But with narrow and technical judges the only thing to 
do was to ask Congress for a more specific act. The power 
was there. Senator Sawyer was chairman of the Post- 
"Office Committee of the Senate, and his committee lis "
tened to Judge Gresham on many occasions as to how the 
act should be amended. It was six years before the Post 
master-General s suggested amendments became law. Then 
"the Lottery Company, after the State of Louisiana turned "
"against it, moved to Honduras; and during the second "
"Cleveland administration, Mr. Gresham helped William S. "
Bissell frame a statute that effectually suppressed it. 

After the dissolution of the injunction by Judge Bil 
"lings, the Lottery Company and the First National Bank "
"of New Orleans brought suits for $100,000 each against "
Walter Q. Gresham for exceeding his powers as Postmaster- 
General in denying them the use of the mails. 

"At that time Mr. Blaine was writing his ""Twenty Years "
"in Congress."" Judge Gresham belonged to the branch of "
the Republican Party that was opposed to Mr. Blaine. 
"An intimacy between the two was started by Dr. Bartlett, "
"our minister, who came to the house one evening and said "
that he did not know Mr. Blaine personally but would like 
"very much to meet him. My husband said, ""We will go "
"and call on him,"" and they did so that evening. Mr. "
"Blaine returned the call the next day, and after that was "
a frequent visitor at our house. No man could be more 
agreeable or attractive than Mr. Blaine when he set about 
to make himself engaging. 

Sometimes Mr. Blaine and Judge Harlan met on a 
"Sunday morning. They talked about the war, the Amend "
"ments to the Constitution, the surplus, and the personnel "
of the different men on both sides who had participated in 
the Rebellion. Mr. Blaine discussed General Grant freely. 



494 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"He called him the ""Old Man,"" and said, ""He liked popular "
"applause more than any man I ever knew."" From his "
manner it seemed to me that Mr. Blaine regretted he had 
"not ""served time"" during the Rebellion. One subject "
"never was discussed, and that was the Cincinnati Conven "
"tion of 1876, when it was said the opposition (in which John "
"M. Harlan was a leader) to Mr. Blaine, at a critical stage, to "
"head off a stampede to Blaine, turned out the lights in the "
convention hall and thus secured an adjournment they 
could not otherwise have secured. Then it was the deal 
was made whereby Hayes was nominated and Harlan was to 
be put on the Supreme bench. 

We were in Washington until late in the summer. I 
made up my mind to be prepared for New Year s and for 
the Cabinet and other dinners we would be required to 
give the coming winter. While there were no caterers in 
Washington in those days as there were when I was there 
"the second time, and as there are now, there were a few "
fine old colored cooks who were engaged long in advance 
of the season. The most noted one of these was a Mrs. 
Brown. I sent for her and engaged her for the opening 
"of the season, which is New Year s day, and then for the "
first Cabinet dinner. She was a wonderful cook. My 
"New Year s reception came off all right. Mrs. Chandler, "
"wife of the Secretary of the Navy, came in to see me one "
"day just before the dinner, to know why I had taken Mrs. "
Brow r n away from her and how in the world I had found 
"her out, saying that Mrs. Brown was the finest cook in "
"Washington and she had always had her for New Year s, "

"With the assembling of Congress in December, John G. "
Carlisle was selected by the Democrats as Speaker of the 
"House over Samuel Randall, the Protectionist Democrat "
from Pennsylvania. The cabinet receptions then began. 
"It was all new to me, and as my husband was then looked "
on as the man to whom Mr. Arthur might turn in the event 
that Mr. Arthur became convinced he could not secure the 



IN PRESIDENT ARTHUR S CABINET 495 

"nomination, we had great crowds at our receptions. As a "
"foil, Mr. Blaine was saying General Sherman should be "
"nominated. Senator Sherman was not then a candidate, "
while General Sherman was as warm and cordial as he was 
the first time I met him at Memphis during the war. He 
said he was for Gresham. He came to my first afternoon 
reception. Somehow it was learned that he was a frequent 
visitor and this brought a great many people who wanted 
"a chance to talk with him. More people, I thought, came "
to see General Sherman than came to see me. One even 
"ing when General Sherman came in, as he did quite often, "
"he said, ""I like to come to your receptions; it is like going "
"to a Sunday school convention."" He meant, there were "
so many people there. 

General Grant made a visit to Washington and came 
to see us. This at once satisfied the diplomats that my 
husband was something more than the average man in 
"Washington, and the result w r as that we saw more of the "
diplomats than did the ordinary members of the cabinet 
"outside of the Secretary of State, whose official duties bring "
him in close contact with the diplomatic corps. 

"That Fall, when Mr. Blaine came back to Washington, "
his house was the head of one party and the White House 
"of another. As the winter wore on, Mr. Blaine became an "
"active candidate for nomination, and Mr. Arthur likewise. "

After Mr. Elaine s return for the winter we saw much 
"of the Blaine family, until one day Mr. Blaine said to my "
"husband, ""I can be nominated, but I cannot be elected. "
Arthur cannot be nominated. Why do you stay with him? 
You can be elected. If you will make me Secretary of 
"State, you can be nominated at Chicago."" My husband "
told him that he could not talk about a matter of that kind 
as long as he was in the President s cabinet. 

"Mrs. McElroy, Mr. Arthur s sister, who came to Wash "
ington that winter and occupied the White House as its 
"mistress, was a very sensible woman. She said they feared "
32



496 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"that in the event of General Arthur s being nominated, "
there would be many people who would consider him re 
sponsible for the assassination of President Garfield. This 
was because he had gone to Albany with Senators Platt and 
Conkling to aid them in their re-election to the Senate after 
they had resigned from the Senate when William S. Robert 
son was appointed collector of the port of New York at 
"Mr. Elaine s instance, and contrary to what was claimed "
the agreement made by General Garfield before the election 
as to the distribution of the New York offices. 

The great public question that was thrusting itself on 
the people when Chester A. Arthur succeeded to the Presi 
"dency, namely, the surplus in the United States Treasury "
we were still under the war tariffs he had seized with 
"the grasp of a statesman. He was an educated, cultured, "
"accomplished gentleman, honest and patriotic. He had "
been successful in the practice of his chosen profession 
"of law, and possessed fine executive ability. His large ex "
"perience as collector of the port at New York, where more "
than two-thirds of all the revenue of the Government derived 
"from customs or tariff laws was collected, had given him a "
"knowledge of the legislation, the details of administration, "
and the ramification and needs of the business interests of 
"the nation that few men who ever served in Washington, "
"whether in legislative or executive positions, possessed. "
His removal from the New York collectorship by President 
"Hayes and Secretary of the Treasury John Sherman, in "
"which James G. Elaine had had a hand, was purely for "
political reasons one of the steps taken to prevent General 
Grant s third nomination in 1880. 

Elected one of the delegates at large from the State of 
"New York to the Chicago convention, General Arthur voted "
steadily as one of the 306 for Grant s nomination. After 
"the break in the convention, which gave the nomination to "
"James A. Garfield, Mr. Arthur was unanimously nominated "
"for Vice-President, and, contrary to the wishes of Senator "



IN PRESIDENT ARTHURS CABINET 497 

"Conkling and of Thomas C. Platt, promptly accepted. "

Mr. Arthur did not regard his factional friendships as 
"any warrant for ignoring the proprieties, the traditions, and "
the duties of the Presidency. He believed he could get 
away from the bitterness of the Blaine-Conkling quarrel 
and the attempt to nominate General Grant for a third 
term. He and his associates in the cabinet thought that 
"the proper presentation to the American people, by his "
"administration, of the right way to reduce the surplus in "
"the Treasury, would carry with it at their hands a nomi "
nation and re-election in 1884. The people approved the 
"Arthur plan of reducing the revenue, but the factionalism of "
that time prevented the nomination. 

President Arthur had the power to nominate himself 
had he used his patronage and the prestige of his office. 
This is manifest from the party platform of the year. But 
"aside from patriotic and moral considerations, he was wise "
"enough, if it be put on another ground than that of policy, "
to refrain from the use of patronage and force to secure 
the nomination. 

"John Sherman, as Secretary of the Treasury, in his last "
"report to Congress, December i, 1880, ""suggested"" a re "
duction of the customs duties. He predicated it on the 
facts he called to the attention of Congress: The resump 
"tion of specie payments by January i, 1879; the importation "
"of $97,000,000 gold for the year ending January 30, 1880, "
"instead of exporting gold, as had been done every year since "
specie payments had been suspended in 1862; a surplus in 
"the Treasury of $37,000,000 after meeting the expenses of "
the government and the requirements of the sinking fund 
"for the year ending June 30, 1880; and an estimated surplus "
"of $50,000,000 for the year to end June 30, 1881. "

It was too early to recommend an actual revision; al 
though the operation of the war taxes in time of peace 
"had reduced the war debt $850,000,000 since the debt had "
"reached its maximum of $2,750,000,000 on the 3ist day of "



498 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"August, 1865. Therefore Secretary Sherman recommended "
that Congress appoint a commission to investigate and 
report as to how the tariff schedules should be revised. 

"The surplus for the year ending June 30, 1881, increased "
"beyond what John Sherman had estimated. It was $100,- "
"000,000. So President Arthur and Charles J. Folger, his "
"Secretary of the Treasury, urged upon the Congress which "
"met in December, 1881, a reduction of the revenue as a "
means of reducing the surplus in the Treasury. President 
"Arthur said: ""I agree with the Secretary of the Treasury "
"that the law imposing a stamp tax upon matches, proprie "
"tary articles, playing cards, checks, and drafts, may with "
"propriety be repealed, and the law, also by which banks "
and bankers are assessed upon their capital and deposits; 
"in short, all internal revenue taxes should be repealed ex "
cept those upon tobacco and distilled spirits and fermented 
liquors. But that due regard may be paid to the conflict 
"ing interests of our citizens, important changes should be "
made with caution. If a careful revision cannot be made 
at this session a commission such as was lately approved 
by the Senate and is now recommended by the Secretary 
of the Treasury would lighten the labors of Congress when 
"ever this subject shall be brought to its consideration."" "

"On the 1 5th of May, 1882, Congress provided for such "
"a commission, with instructions to report when Congress "
met December 4. The commission was appointed by 
President Arthur. He sent its report to Congress as that 
body had requested. The annual surplus had grown to 
"$145,000,000 for the year ending June 30, 1882. Both the "
President and the commission recommended a reduction of 
customs duties. The reductions as recommended by the 
commission averaged 20 per cent. Congress made a reduc 
tion that averaged about one per cent. Senator Sherman 
afterwards said that had the report of the commission been 
"adopted, it would have taken the tariff out of politics for "
"many years to come. But unfortunately, he did not take "



IN PRESIDENT ARTHURS CABINET 499 

that view of it when it was before Congress. He sided 
with the tariff barons and defeated its recommendations. 

"Colonel W. R. Morrison of Illinois, as chairman of the "
Ways and Means Committee of the Congress that assembled 
"in December, 1883, and was in session when the National "
"Republican Convention met in Chicago in June, 1884, re "
ported a bill to reduce the tariff by a horizontal reduction 
"all along the line, without considering the question of either "
revenue or protection. This report only gave rise to a 
"great debate and its author was dubbed, ""Horizontal Bill."" "

Mr. Elaine was opposed at this time to reducing the 
customs duties. He had advocated getting rid of the sur 
plus by distributing it pro rata to the States. 

My husband wrote his report to the President as Post 
master-General one night at our home. He urged the amend 
ment of the postal laws as a means of suppressing the Louis 
iana Lottery; and recommended the extension of the rail 
"way mail service, cheaper postage, the reduction from three "
"to two cents for ordinary letters, and opposed the govern "
ment taking over the telegraph lines as part of the postal 
systems. 

"It was left to Secretary Folger, inasmuch as the annual "
"report of the Secretary of the Treasury, under the law, was "
"made to Congress, to confute Mr. Elaine s proposition to "
get rid of the surplus in the Treasury by distributing it to 
the States. The idea had originated in General Jackson s 
"time, to dispose of the surplus derived from the sale of the "
public domain. 

Mr. Folger had attained eminence as a jurist on the Court 
"of Appeals of New York, whence Mr. Arthur had made him "
"Secretary of the Treasury. The ""knifing"" he received at "
the hands of both the Elaine and Platt factions while the 
administration candidate for Governor of New York at the 
"November election of 1882, when Grover Cleveland attained "
"his unprecedented majority of 200,000, was most unjust "
and should not have affected him as it did he almost 



500 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"became a recluse. It was purely a political defeat, not a "
personal one. He was a widower and went but little into 
"society. My husband s sympathy for him, his former judi "
"cial experience, and his zeal in Mr. Arthur s interests, as "
well as his conviction that the customs duties should be re 
"duced, brought him in close touch with Mr. Folger, who "
consulted him about the line of argument he should use in 
confuting Mr. Elaine s proposition. 

Elaine and the distinguished men of General Jackson s 
"time were not referred to by name, but Secretary Folger "
constructed such a dispassionate judicial consideration of 
the proposition to get rid of the surplus by distributing it 
"pro rat a to the States, that it was never again advanced by "
"any one, not even by Mr. Elaine. Then the Secretary "
followed with an irresistible argument in favor of the reduc 
"tion of the customs duties. In his reports and in Mr, Ar "
thur s messages is found the best practical exposition extant 
"of the finances and the tariffs of the government, taking "
"into consideration ""the conflicting interests of all the citizens."" "

Their ideas to be departed from in 1888 as well as 
"the traditions of the party, were incorporated into the Re "
publican platform of 1884: 

The Republican Party pledges itself to correct the inequal 
"ities of the tariff and to reduce the surplus, not by the vicious "
"and indiscriminate process of horizontal reduction, but by such "
methods as will relieve the taxpayer without injuring the laborer 
or the great productive interests of the country. 

"Colonel John W. Foster came home from Spain, where "
"he was our representative, and helped organize the Arthur "
forces. But his mission was that of the diplomat and not 
that of the leader. 

"Thomas C. Platt in his ""Memoirs"" speaks of his cordial "
relations with President Arthur. But it is a fact that Platt 
was against Arthur s renomination. After the 1884 con 
"vention, Mr. Platt justified his opposition by saying that "



IN PRESIDENT ARTHURS CABINET 501 

when he had recovered from his failure to be returned to 
"the Senate, after he and Roscoe Conkling had resigned and "
"were working back into active politics, he wrote President "
"Arthur a letter, which was not answered. After awhile "
another letter was written to Mr. Arthur. Receiving no 
"answer to his second letter, Mr. Platt said he then deter "
mined on his course. I know Judge Gresham and Secre 
tary Folger thought they had placated Mr. Platt. They 
"had several interviews with him in New York, on behalf "
of Mr. Arthur and with Mr. Arthur s consent. The oppo 
sition of the administration would have defeated Platt s 
election as a delegate to the Chicago convention from the 
"Tioga district. Mr. Platt, without pledging himself, had "
created the impression I know it was Judge Walter Q. 
Gresham. s and Secretary Folger s that he would support 
"Arthur. Henry M. Teller, a native of New York, and "
"then Secretary of the Interior, a friend of Mr. Platt, also "
expected him to vote for Mr. Arthur. I know the Elaine 
people in Washington did not know that Platt was then 
"with them because the New York Tribune, which was Mr. "
"Elaine s chief organ, denounced the election of Platt to "
the Chicago convention. It said the Elaine people had been 
"misled in the Tioga district, but at the Chicago convention "
Platt came squarely out for Elaine and made a speech in 
"his support. Instead of resentment against Mr. Arthur, "
the real reason for Mr. Platt s vote was an understanding 
with Mr. Elaine. 

General Logan was a candidate and so was Senator Ed 
munds. Mr. Elaine s friends were able to organize the 
"convention. The Logan votes, which were confined to "
"Illinois, were Elaine votes in disguise. After the second "
"ballot they were transferred to Mr. Elaine, who was nom "
inated on the fourth ballot. General Logan was named 
for Vice-President. I well remember the disappointment 
"in Washington, especially among the women. Mrs. Elaine "
did not share the personal popularity of her husband. 



502 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN G RE SHAM 

Even young girls expressed regret that Mrs. Elaine might 
be the mistress of the White House. 

Judge Folger died and Walter Q. Gresham was trans 
ferred to the Treasury Department. During the two months 
he was at the head of that department he made many in 
vestigations and inaugurated some reforms. In the cam 
paign that followed he made a speech in New York at a 
meeting of the business men in Wall Street. He spoke as 
Secretary of the Treasury. The business men of New York 
had been unanimously for Mr. Arthur s nomination. This 
speech was prepared with special care. He did not deem it 
"wise to say anything about Mr. Elaine s greenback record, "
"but he did assail the record of Thomas A. Hendricks, the "
"Democratic candidate for Vice- President, w r ho had opposed "
the issue of the greenbacks as a war measure and then op 
"posed their retirement, and at that time was demanding "
that the cash balance in the Treasury be applied at once on 
the war debt. A clear exposition of the financial legislation 
"from 1860 down to that time was made, and the only prac "
tical way to keep the greenbacks afloat as a legal tender - 
"a proposition that the business men could appreciate, my "
husband said was for the government to carry enough 
gold in the Treasury to meet the greenbacks as presented. 
Governor Hendricks plan to deplete the Treasury at once 
by applying all its cash on hand on the war debt would 
"not do, could not be credited to his intelligence, and re "
ceived the approval of no man of affairs. He made a clear 
"exposition of the workings of the sinking fund, clearer than "
is set forth in any of the reports. Six per cent bonds with 
twenty years to run had been sold by our government for 
"less than ninety cents. ""Now the government can put out "
"3 per cents at a premium."" The speech was in part reported "
in the New York Tribune: 

No one at home or abroad doubts that our war debt will be 
fully and honestly paid if the Republican party is continued in 
power. The public credit has been so firmly established arid the 



IN PRESIDENT ARTHURS CABINET 503 

public debt so largely reduced that we can now safely reduce 
taxation within the demands of the law creating the sinking 
fund. The law requires the purchase or payment of one per 
cent of the entire debt within each fiscal year and an additional 
amount equal to the interest upon all bonds previously purchased 
for the sinking fund. The government entered into a solemn 
obligation with its creditors to use in this manner a certain pro 
portion of the revenue derived from the duties on imports. This 
"engagement was entered into, it is to be borne in mind, at a time "
when the public credit was distrusted by many and the bonds 
were worth much less than now. In some years the debt had 
been reduced beyond the requirement of this bond. A liberal 
"estimate will not require more than $50,000,000 for the sinking "
"fund of the current year, and we will have a surplus over this "
"of, say, $40,000,000 or $50,000,000. The steady development "
of the country and the growth of its trade and commerce will 
"increase the revenues under existing laws. There is, therefore, "
"no necessity for maintaining our present rate of taxation, but, in "
"view of the records of the two parties, is it not safer to trust the "
Republicans to manage our finances and to reduce taxation within 
reasonable limits ? Why should the Democratic Party be trusted 
to accomplish this or any other good result in legislation or 
administration ? 

"In revising our tariff laws and reducing our customs revenues, "
home interests should not be neglected. Indeed protection to 
our manufacturers and laborers can and should be afforded by 
taxing only such imports as come into real competition and 
admitting others free. 

Mr. Elaine said it was the best speech made in New 
"York for him that year, and he repeated this statement a "
year later when he passed through Chicago on his way to 
the Pacific Coast. After showing Walter Q. Gresham s 
"judicial work in its chronological order, it may be interest "
ing to observe how Mr. Blaine and the Republican party 
in 1888 departed from the platform of 1884 and from its 
previous history. 



CHAPTER XXXII 
ON THE BENCH AGAIN 



BECOMES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR SEVENTH DISTRICT 
#NAME?

FULLER S APPOINTMENT AS CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE SU 
PREME COURT CORDIAL RELATIONS OF HARLAN AND 
GRESHAM THE SUPREME COURT S IGNORANCE OF PAT 
ENT LITIGATION THE LAWTHER-HAMILTON CASE. 

"NOVEMBER 2, 1884, Walter Q. Gresham accepted an "
appointment as United States Judge for the Seventh 
Circuit to fill the vacancy occasioned by the resignation 
of Judge Thomas Drummond. The next day he left 
"Washington for Indianapolis, to vote, then went on to "
"Chicago, where on November 10 he began calling the "
chancery calendar. The next day he took up the hearing 
"of cases and continued this, except for a number of trips "
"to Washington, until late in the following August. Then "
after a short vacation he steadily held court again at 
"Chicago, Springfield, Peoria, Indianapolis, Milwaukee, and "
"Madison, until late in August of 1886. "

The visits to Washington were made necessary by the 
suit of the Louisiana Lottery Company. The case went 
to the Supreme Court before it was finally disposed of. At 
"first the law officers of the government, after the ist of "
"March, 1885, were not disposed to defend the ex-postmaster- "
general. But Mr. Cleveland took Mr. Arthur s position 
"that, inasmuch as the exclusion of the Lottery Company s "
"mail was done as an official act, the government should "
defend the suits. Overtures of the Lottery Company to 
settle were rejected. 

"It was early in Mr. Arthur s administration, during a "

504



ON THE BENCH AGAIN 505 

"visit to Rochester, that Walter Q. Gresham first met Grover "
Cleveland. On one of his visits to Washington soon after 
Mr. Cleveland had entered the White House my husband 
"told him not to fear the politicians, that the people wanted "
"a practical, efficient administration; they would sustain the "
President while acting on these lines against any body of 
men in Congress. The Senate was then in the control of 
"the Republicans, and he cited the case of Roscoe Conkling. "
"The contest over appointments came with the Republicans, "
"led by Senator George F. Edmunds, but popular opinion "
forced the Senate to recede. 

On one of the visits to Washington Mr. Cleveland asked 
Judge Gresham if he would write and give his views when 
requested as to the fitness of men recommended for judicial 
positions. This was done in many instances. After we 
"were members of Mr. Cleveland s administration, Daniel "
Lamont told me on one occasion that Cleveland had said 
to him that he had made a mistake in not appointing 
Judge Gresham Chief Justice instead of Melville W. Fuller. 
On the death of Chief Justice Waite there was a Republican 
"majority in the United States Senate, and it was a "
problem to get a Democrat who could be confirmed. John 
Scofield of the Illinois Supreme Court was offered the 
"chief justiceship and had Judge Gresham s indorsement, "
but Judge Schofield declined it because Mrs. Schofield did 
"not want to go to Washington to live. Schofield s opinions, "
"in the Illinois reports, show that he would have graced the "
position. 

The objection that Melville Fuller had been a Dough 
"Face"" during the war long deferred the sending in of his "
name to the Senate; it was feared he could not be con 
"firmed. Judge Gresham urged upon the soldier element, "
"and especially on some of those who were lawyers, that "
such consideration should no longer obtain in determining 
the qualifications of men for judicial positions. He per 
"suaded Senator Charles Farwell of Chicago, a practical "



506 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"business man, to agree in advance to vote for Fuller s con "
"firmation. He sent men like General Charles Fitzsimmons, "
who had been not only a good soldier but also an Aboli 
"tionist, to Senator Cullom to suggest the propriety of "
agreeing to support Fuller. The promise of both the 
Illinois senators to vote for Fuller made his appointment 
"certain, and his name went in to the Senate for con "
firmation. 

In the face of similar objections to the appointment of 
Joshua R. Allen as United States District Judge for the 
"Southern District of Illinois, Judge Gresham, when re "
quested by Mr. Cleveland to state his views as to a num 
ber of Illinois lawyers w r ho were suggested as suitable to 
"succeed Judge Treat, recommended Judge Allen s appoint "
"ment, and afterwards, when it was made, defended it. "
The circuit judge refused Senator John M. Palmer s re 
quest to recommend to Mr. Cleveland one of Senator 
Palmer s own sons for the position. This gave the Sen 
"ator a grievance, but after a time he mellowed. "

"When Walter Q. Gresham went back on the bench, the "
"Seventh Circuit was composed of the States of Indiana, "
"Illinois, and Wisconsin. In Wisconsin Charles E. Dyer "
"was still the district judge in the Eastern District, but "
Romanzo Bunn had succeeded Judge Hopkins in the West 
ern District. Henry W. Blodgett was still the district 
"judge in the Northern District, and Samuel H. Treat in the "
"Southern District; William A. Woods, who had succeeded "
"Walter Q. Gresham, was the district judge in Indiana. "
The circuit judge could not hold the District Court while 
the district judge could sit in the Circuit Court. The 
circuit judge had appellate jurisdiction over the District 
Court in some classes of litigation. 

John M. Harlan was the member of the Supreme Court 
assigned to the Seventh Circuit as the circuit judge. It 
"was an open secret that had there existed a vacancy, "
Mr. Arthur w r ould have appointed Judge Gresham to the 



ON THE BENCH AGAIN 507 

"Supreme bench, and members of the court intimated they "
would be glad to have him join them. 

"The law contemplated, if it did not require, that the "
circuit justices should visit each district once in every two 
years. But the Supreme Court was so far behind that the 
visits of the circuit justices to their circuits were at long 
intervals and were as short as possible. When the Supreme 
"Court was not in session, its members were engaged much "
"of their time, Judge Harlan wrote, in consultation and in "
writing opinions. A great deal of work thus devolved on 
the circuit judge. The correspondence betw r een Justice 
Harlan and Circuit Judge Gresham about the business in 
"the Seventh Circuit and also about personal matters, was "
cordial and voluminous. There was also much correspond 
"ence with the district judges and with Howell E. Jackson, "
the circuit judge in the Sixth Circuit. 

"Of the correspondence with the judges, much with "
Justice Harlan and District Judge Woods of the Seventh 
"Circuit, and with Circuit Judge Howell E. Jackson and "
"District Judge Sage of the Sixth, was in relation to rail "
road receiverships. When Walter Q. Gresham went back 
"on the bench there were the ""Narrow Gauge,"" the Illinois "
"Midland, and the Wabash Railroad receiverships. The "
first two were then most alive. Soon others followed. 
The Wabash was to become the most celebrated. 

The Narrow Gauge was a system of railroads extending 
"from Toledo, Ohio, to St. Louis, Missouri, with a branch "
"from Delphos, Ohio, to Cincinnati, and a branch from this "
"line at Dayton, Ohio, to Ironton on the Ohio River. The "
"corporation which had built it, the Toledo, Cincinnati &amp; "
"St. Louis Railroad Company, was hopelessly insolvent, with "
all kinds of creditors. The Illinois Midland Railway 
"Company acquired a line from Peoria through Atlanta, "
"Decatur, and Paris, to Terre Haute, Indiana. On both "
these lines construction had been poor and earnings small. 

Judge Harlan wrote that on the Midland there were 



508 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"no less than eighteen series of Receiver s certificates, aggre "
"gating $700,000 more, he was afraid, than the entire line "
"would sell for. ""The Midland case is the worst I ever "
"heard of,"" he declared. ""More than a year ago, January "
"2, 1885, I was over-persuaded to take hold of it. Judge "
"Drummond would not, and Judge Treat will make no "
further order in the case unless some other judge will sit 
"with him."" Judge Treat was then far beyond three score "
"and ten and eligible for retirement, but, like many Federal "
"judges, he held on until death removed him, although he "
should have retired years before. 

"Judge Harlan said that Judge Treat ""should not have "
"allowed the issuance of so many Receiver s certificates, but "
you must not let him know I am criticizing him. I want 
you to help me out in this case. It will take us a week to 
"hear it. I will come to Chicago at the February, 1885, "
adjournment of the Supreme Court and we will hear it 
"together, and then you can dispose of it. It is too much "
"to ask another judge to take it up anew."" This was to be "
"the final hearing, but Justice Harlan s work held him in "
"Washington, so the joint hearing did not take place. "

Meantime the Narrow Gauge case was being crowded 
"along by Judge Gresham to a decree of sale, so as to get "
it out of court. Joint hearings were held with Judges 
"Jackson and Sage of the Sixth Circuit, at Cleveland and "
Cincinnati. Expenses were reduced to the minimum; the 
"daily train service consisted only of one ""mixed"" train each "
way. Rolling stock which had been purchased on time be 
"yond what seemed to be the needs of the road, was ten "
dered back to the rolling stock companies with the choice 
of suing the corporation and the Receiver in so far as he 
"had ratified the contracts of sale, or demanding a fair rental "
value for the time the cars were held by the Receiver. No 
"Receiver s certificates were issued, but the road was sold "
subject to the right of the court to order the payment by 
the purchaser of the claims of the rolling stock claimants 



ONTHEBENCHAGAIN 509 

out of the proceeds of sale prior to the mortgage bond 
"holders, provided the court so decreed, with a right of "
"appeal to the Supreme Court, the property itself remain "
ing as security for the final payment of the claims if so 
allowed. Meanwhile a committee representing the bond 
"holders was provisionally"" given possession of the railroad "
and the rolling stock. By this method the road was prompt 
"ly released from the hands of the court, and the contingency "
of the bondholders buying in the property at a song was 
guarded against. 

I am glad you are making such good progress with 
"the Narrow Gauge case,"" wrote Justice Harlan in May; "
"1885. In June, 1885, he came to Chicago, and after the "
"hearing, entered a final decree in the Midland case. The "
"laborers were paid first, and most of the Receiver s certifi "
"cates were held to be valid, although some were issued "
under orders of the court without notice to the bond 
"holders, and, technically, were invalid. "

"The bondholders in the Midland case wanted to appeal, "
"so Judge Harlan wrote Judge Gresham, August n, 1885, "
that he had telegraphed the attorneys for the bondhold 
"ers to appear before him, Judge Gresham, and let him fix "
"the bond that would supersede the decree. ""An appeal to "
"our court,"" wrote Justice Harlan, ""will tie up the distri "
"bution to the laborers and small claimants for three years, "
and that ought not to be. Make the penalty in the bond 
"large, unless the bondholders, appellants, will agree that "
the appeal may be taken up on brief or short time after the 
"record gets here, and I will get the court to pass on it "
"promptly. The laborers ought to be promptly paid."" "

"Justice Harlan s letter, twelve pages long, written with "
"his own hand from Winchester, Virginia, his country home, "
is a better exposition of the Midland case than his official 
opinion. In this letter he said he realized the justice of the 
criticisms of the delay in disposing of the Midland litiga 
"tion, although he had no fears for himself, adding that he "



510 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

had been threatened with bodily harm in anonymous com 
"munications, because of the delay. "

But the time had expired sixty days from the entry 
of the decree within which a circuit judge could enter 
an order approving an appeal bond to stay the operation 
"of the decree appealed from; that is, make the appeal a "
"supersedeas. As the law then was, only a justice or the "
"Supreme Court itself, after sixty days from the time of "
"entry of the decree, could name the penalty in, and approve "
"the appeal bond, so as to make it a supersedeas. The at "
"torneys, therefore, had to go to Washington for this pur "
pose. Justice Harlan made them agree to advance the cases 
"before he would approve their appeal bond, and the next "
Spring this appeal was passed on by the Supreme Court 
and all that Justice Harlan had done was approved. In 
"upsetting vested interests, Judge Gresham in the Narrow "
Gauge case did not go beyond Justice Harlan in the Mid 
"land case indeed, he did not go so far. Further mention "
of these appeals will be deferred until we corne to the 
"appeals in the Narrow Gauge case, which took the regular "
"course and were not passed on until 1891, w r hen the Supreme "
Court administered a rebuke to Judge Gresham for what in 
the meantime he had done in the Wabash receivership. 

"Always ready to do his share of the Circuit Court work, "
"except in patent litigation, Justice Harlan was sometimes "
compelled by the increased work in the Supreme Court to 
"cancel appointments he had made to visit the circuit, and "
"then he would write to tell the attorneys, I will give them "
the morning hour in Washington before the Supreme Court 
"meets and in the evening after adjournment."" That the "
overcrowded dockets in the Northern District of Illinois 
"might be relieved, Justice Harlan wrote how he and Justice "
Blatchford construed certain sections of the statutes so 
that judges from other districts might be summoned to 
that district to hold court and be allowed $10 per day for 
their expenses. It was manifestly unjust for Congress to 



ON THE BENCH AGAIN 511 

make laws that permitted the poorly paid district judges to 
be called from their districts to hold court in other districts 
without making specific provisions for their expenses when 
so engaged. So the suggestion of Justice Harlan as to this 
construction of the statute was promptly adopted. With 
the aid of Justice Harlan and the other district judges in the 
"circuit, the dockets at Chicago and throughout the circuit "
were cleared and pace was kept with the increasing business 
"at Chicago. After several years, Judge Gresham and his "
associates on the district bench were able to write Justice 
"Harlan, ""There are no cases undisposed of that need your "
"attention on the circuit."" "

I have already commented on the aversion of many of 
the Supreme Court judges to handling patent litigation. 
Justice Harlan frankly avowed his position. I quote from 
"one of his letters as an example. March 20, 1887, he wrote "
"Judge Gresham: ""Let me say that I am in good condi "
"tion now, and will take hold of any business you may put "
on my dockets except patent cases which involve scientific 
investigation. I have no fancy and but little aptitude for 
"that branch of the law."" "

"Other judges, both on and off the Supreme bench, con "
"cealed their ignorance behind the formula, ""No invention, "
"no novelty."" Some judges adopted the principle that, "
"prima facie, all patents are void, and then bent their men "
tal energy to sustain this pre-conceived opinion. Judge 
Gresham was not in this class. After his return to the 
"bench his first reported opinion is in a patent case, delivered "
"two weeks after he began his work, November 25, 1884. "
During the eight years he continued on the bench he passed 
on patents involving all kinds of machinery and electrical 
appliances. In a majority of the cases the patents were 
sustained. The fact that it was asserted there was mani 
pulation and political and other influences at work in the 
"Patent Office at Washington, was not prejudicial to any "
patentee until the contrary was shown. He was not afraid 
33



512 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN ORE SHAM 

"to sustain a monopoly within the law, indeed, he considered "
it his duty to do so. Chauncey M. Depew said it would 
never do to nominate Gresham because he upheld the 
Driven Well patent. He was sustained in this decision by 
"a divided Supreme Court, four to four. It takes a majority "
to reverse. At that term there was a vacancy by reason 
of the death of Justice Clifford. But neither side wrote an 
opinion. 

"John W. Munday, one of the best patent lawyers of his "
"time, filed for his client a bill, Lawther vs. Hamilton, in "
the United States Circuit Court for the Western District 
"of Wisconsin, for an injunction and damages, in which the "
"claim was made that General Hamilton, who was then "
United States Marshal for the Western District of Wis 
"consin, was ""infringing Letter Patent No. 168164, granted "
"September 28, 1875, for an improvement in the process of "
"crushing linseed, flaxseed, and other oil seeds, and extract "
"ing the oil therefrom."" It became the property of the "
Linseed Oil Company or Trust. There was a hearing by 
"Judge Dyer, who, instead of deciding the case, ordered a "
"rehearing at which he asked Judge Drummond, wiio was "
"still the Circuit Judge, to sit with him. "

"Two years after the bill was filed, June 2, 1884, Judge "
"Drummond sent for Mr. Munday and said, ""We are going "
to decide this case against you. I wish you would tell me 
"where that authority is that sustains our position."" "

"But, Judge, I am on the other side. "

"Yes, but you are an officer of my court, and are "
"familiar with the authorities."" "

But there is no such authority. 

"Finally Mr. Munday said, ""Judge, there is a textbook "
on patents in which there are authorities both ways. This 
"much I will concede, but the authorities that tended your "
"way, Judge, were not well considered, and do not apply to "
"this Lawther case."" Afterward, Mr. Munday said, ""I got "
the textbook on Patents and took it to Judge Drummond. 



ON THE BENCH AGAIN 513 

"They beat me all right, but Judge Dyer, after all, wrote "
"the opinion."" "

Lawther followed his lawyer s advice and appealed to 
"the Supreme Court, where Munday argued the case. In "
"an opinion by Justice Bradley, the Supreme Court reversed "
the decree of Judges Drummond and Dyer in dismissing the 
"bill, and remanded the case with directions to sustain the "
"patent, ascertain the damages for its infringement, and "
enter a decree for that amount in Lawther s favor. 1 

Judge Dyer referred the case to Master in Chancery 
"Ryan, who, after a year s time, reported the damages at "
"six cents, while Munday claimed that under the evidence "
"he had proved up damages to the amount of $63,000. "
"After the case was reversed, Judge Drummond, who had "
"retired and had been succeeded by Walter Q. Gresham, "
adhered to his opinion and said the Supreme Court was 
wrong. Munday excepted to Master Ryan s award of six 
cents damages and went to Judge Gresham and demand 
ed a hearing. General Hamilton s total wealth was just 
"about $63,000 on a forced sale. I now quote Mr. Munday: "

"Judge Gresham gave us a decree for $53,000. He al "
"ways was for leaving the debtor something, and when there "
"was no exemption law applicable, he stretched the equity "
"rules. It was thus he left the old general $10,000. Mean "
"while, the National Linseed Oil Company had bought out "
Lawther. I reported the situation to my client: that while 
"Judge Gresham ought to have given a decree for $63,000 "
"I guess he just concluded to leave the old general $10,000, "
"that notwithstanding Judge Gresham s award, General "
"Hamilton still thinks he is right, and while I shall collect "
"the $53,000 if the general does not appeal, I think it would "
be just as well for us to settle. 

At what figure will you recommend a settlement? 
asked the president of the company. 

 Five thousand dollars. 

"1 Lawther vs. Hamilton, 124 U. S. i. "



514 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

Do you recommend that as a lawyer or as a man ? 

" As a man, and incidentally as a lawyer. "

" There will be a directors meeting this afternoon, Mr. "
"Munday, and I will submit your proposition to them. "

The directors authorized Mr. Munday to settle the 
case as he had recommended. 

"After General Hamilton had paid the lawyer the $5,000, "
Mr. Munday told Judge Gresham how he had closed the 
"case. Judge Gresham said, ""I am glad of it. There was "
nothing else for me to do under that Supreme Court man 
date. But I will never again feel that corporate manage 
ment is quite as bad as in many instances I have thought 
"it."" "

A comparison of the opinions of Justice Bradley and 
"Judge Dyer in this Lawther case, in view of the word "
"doubt in Justice Bradley s opinion, warrants the view "
that Judge Dyer had as strong and clear a grasp of the sub 
"ject as Justice Bradley, and that, too, although there was "
no such an authority as John W. Munday says Judge 
Drummond thought there w r as. 

He is a wise lawyer who knows when to let go. Con 
"fronted with the real consequences of its decree or opinion, "
although supported by all of John W. Munday s ability - 
"for he was an advocate as well as a mechanic, one of the "
best in his special line the Supreme Court might not 
"have stood ""hitched."" "

"Unlike Judge Drummond and other judges, Judge "
Gresham never from the bench criticized nor side-stepped 
the mandates of the Supreme Court. He obeyed them 
in good faith. Sometimes he would threaten to resign 
"rather than follow them, and the fact is he did finally "
resign and would never have gone back on the bench had 
"he lived. Off the bench, in his capacity as a man and the "
"master of his profession, he criticized the processes and con "
clusions of his brethren. To-day I am glad to say that the 
mass of the judiciary are interpreting the law more in the 



ON THE BENCH AGAIN 515 

spirit of humanity and justice than prevailed at the time 
of which I am writing. 

"As a circuit judge, Walter Q. Gresham heard and con "
ferred with Justice Harlan and the district judges in the 
Seventh Circuit in all kinds of cases cognizable in the 
Federal courts. In most cases it was after argument in 
"open court. Sometimes there would be oral conferences, "
sometimes by letter. His reported decisions are found 
"in the Federal Reports, beginning at Volume 22 and run "
ning to Volume 56. Some of these openings show that they 
"were submitted to Justice Harlan, although he was not "
present at the hearing of the particular case. 

Not always was there harmony between Circuit Justice 
"Harlan and Circuit Judge Gresham, and the latter, aside "
"from ""the rebuke,"" did not always reflect in advance the "
opinions of the Supreme Court. And when it comes to 
"patent litigation, the reader certainly will not censure the "
circuit judge for not deferring to nor even considering the 
"circuit justice, for he himself had ruled himself out. Mel "
ville W. Fuller was without experience in patent litigation 
while at the bar. He avowed his dislike for it after he be 
"came Chief Justice and his opinions disclose this aversion, "
as do the opinions of other members of that Court when 
"appeals in patent litigation went to it. Now, under the "
"Circuit Court of Appeals Act, which members of the Su "
"preme Court were not without influence in drafting, prac "
tically all of the patent litigation ends in the Circuit Court 
"of Appeals. May 3, 1892, when the Court of Appeals "
"had only been fairly organized, Justice Harlan wrote, ""I "
am perfectly willing to give all the time while I am in 
"Chicago to Court of Appeals business, excluding patent "
"cases."" "

"Constitutional questions are easy compared to ""patent "
"cases which involve scientific investigation."" But no less "
important to the body politic may be the correct deter 
"mination of the patent case. During my husband s time, "



516 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

Justice Joseph Bradley was conceded by patent lawyers to 
be an exception to the rule. Partisan though he w r as 
"charged with being, in ability and learning he was a master "
"of all branches of his profession, including patents. But "
"his opinions, with due deference to the patent lawyer, do "
not disclose a grasp and knowledge of this branch of the 
"law as do the opinions of Henry W. Blodgett, the United "
States Judge for the Northern District of Illinois during the 
period Justice Bradley sat on the Supreme bench. At the 
"bar, both men had had varied and wide experience; neither "
"much, but Blodgett more than Bradley in patent litigation. "
"Appointed to the Federal bench about the same time, one to "
the Supreme bench where there was but little patent liti 
"gation and that of an appellate character, the other to the "
district bench in a district where there was perhaps more 
"patent litigation than in any other district in the country, "
the one hearing one patent case to a score heard by the 
"other, Judge Blodgett in the very nature of things devel "
oped into the more efficient patent judge. When it comes 
to recommending lawyers for appointment to places on 
"the Federal bench, the patent lawyers as a class have never "
united in recommending one of their own number. They 
seem to prefer the appointment of a lawyer without experi 
ence in this branch of the profession. The objection that 
the patent lawyer is only a mechanic always has w r eight 
with the appointing power. But the fact is that there are 
patent lawyers who are not only mechanics but accom 
plished lawyers and men of the highest sense of honor. 
Manifestly there ought always to be at least one man on 
the Supreme bench a master of this branch of the law. 
Because patents are monopolistic in their tendency is no 
"reason for withholding, but it is a reason for scrutinizing "
with the most zealous care the grants of all patents. If 
wrongfully granted and collusively maintained the law 
"yers on opposite sides, working to this end, in a way that "
only an expert can detect they must be withdrawn.

"Inefficient judges are bad for the litigants, but they make "
business for the lawyers. 

As specifically illustrating Walter Q. Gresham s work

THE PULLMAN PALACE CAR PATENT CASES 



THE SESSIONS IMPROVEMENT IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF 
RAILROAD CARS ADOPTED BY THE PULLMAN COMPANY

OPINION CONSOLIDATION OF THE PULLMAN AND WAGNER 
COMPANIES. 

r T A HE Pullman Palace Car Company versus the Wagner 
"-* Palace Car Company was a most important case, out "
side the great financial interests involved. It is typical as 
illustrating the manipulation and influence that may be 
"exercised in the Patent Office and higher up, the attempts "
of able counsel to manipulate the courts in the interests of 
"their clients, and the folly of a great commercial and execu "
tive mind attempting to assume the role of an inventor. 

"April 27, 1887, Henry Howard Sessions, the general "
superintendent of the car shops of the Pullman Palace Car 
"Company, at Pullman, Illinois, filed an application in the "
patent office for a new and useful improvement in the con 
struction of railroad cars. Immediately Sessions assigned 
whatever right he had in this application to the Pullman 
Palace Car Company. At this time Sessions was forty-five 
"years of age, and for three years had been superintendent of "
the Pullman works. At fourteen he had begun work as an 
apprentice in the shops of the Central Vermont Railroad 
"Company, and had passed through all the grades up to "
"that of superintendent, and as such had charge of the car "
building department of various railroads and corporations 

518



PULLMAN PALACE CAR PATENT CASES 519 

whose sole business was that of building railroad cars. He 
had made or helped make every part of railroad passenger 
and freight cars. He was a draftsman of skill and was 
experienced in the phraseology of patents. 

"In 1873, while superintendent of the car shops of the "
"Rome, Watertown &amp; Ogdensburg Railroad, Sessions made "
the first drawing of his invention. His object was to reduce 
the shock of collisions and to prevent the oscillations of cars 
"when running rapidly and around curves, especially experi "
enced by persons occupying upper berths in sleeping cars. 

The means to this end is a frame-shaped plate applied 
vertically from top to bottom and transversely to the end 
of the car. This frame is projected a short distance beyond 
"the end of the car by back springs which, when the cars are "
"coupled together, keep the rough surfaces of the plates on "
the coupled cars in frictional contact by the back pressure. 
"There are springs at the top of the car, but the main spring "
"is at the platform, and part of the force is transmitted along "
the plates to their top. Between the face plates and the 
"springs are ""piston rods."" These piston rods are attached, "
"one end to the face plate, the other to the end of the spring "
in the body of the car. The piston rods can be seen on any 
Pullman or vestibule car above the canvas or rubber hood 
which connects the face plate and the end of the vestibule. 
Neither the hood nor the vestibule was part of the inven 
"tion, and Sessions made no claim to them as such. They "
were old devices. 

In rounding curves the inner springs contract while the 
"outer expand, and thus the opposing face plates are in "
"constant frictional contact, which holds the cars together "
"without oscillation, and diminishes the force of shocks when "
in collisions. 

The president of the Watertown Company said Sessions 
"plan was all right, but that the finances of the railroad "
would not permit of its adoption. George M. Pullman 
was the first man in an executive position on a railroad or 



520 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

in a car manufacturing plant who enabled Sessions to put 
his device into practical operation. He must be given due 
"credit for seeing what other men rejected, but this does not "
entitle him to rank as an inventor or discoverer. A com 
plete vestibule train equipped with the Sessions device was 
finished before the patent was applied for. This train was 
"exhibited at Chicago, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, and in New "
England cities. 

Always the pioneers in railroading and the ablest in 
"their line, the men in control of the Pennsylvania Railroad "
Company promptly caused it to make a contract with the 
Pullman Company for the use of two complete Pullman 
trains equipped w r ith the Sessions device to run opposite 
each other as the first 24-hour trains between Chicago and 
"New York, called ""The Limited."" The Pennsylvania also "
acquired the right to use the Sessions device on its own 
"cars, and embodied this provision in the contract: ""The "
Pullman Company would not license the use of the Ses 
sions invention to any of the competitors of the Penn 
"sylvania Company."" This stipulation was aimed at the "
"New York Central, the only competitor of the Pennsyl "
vania for passenger traffic that desired the fast time between 
New York and Chicago. 

"December 15, 1887, the patent issued, but to the Pullman "
Company as assignee. A few T days later the Pullman Com 
pany brought its suit against the Wagner Company to en 
join it from using the Sessions improvement. The Wagner 
"Company was then operating, and had for a long time prior "
"to that time operated, sleeping cars on the New York Cen "
tral Railroad and its subsidiary lines. The Wagner Com 
"pany, without any leave or license, had begun to use the "
Sessions device soon after Sessions made his application 
for the patent. 

The Wagner Company denied there was any novelty or 
utility in the Sessions patent. It named thirty-four English 
"and American patents that it claimed anticipated it, and "



PULLMAN PALACE CAR PATENT CASES 521 

denied that before it was issued as a patent the application 
of Sessions was subjected to any critical or exhaustive 
investigation in the Patent Office. These denials were 
followed by the assertion that many times was Sessions 
"application rejected, ""and that the examiner finally yielded, "
"as constantly happens in such cases, only to the importunity "
"of the applicant."" "

The testimony included that of patent experts and rail 
"road men of all grades, from mechanics and shop men down "
to railroad presidents. The thirty-four patents were criti 
"cally examined by the experts and the court, but no evidence "
was offered in support of the assertion that the Wagner 
Company had made in its answer as to the Patent Office. 

The case on final hearing came before Judges Gresham 
and Blodgett. They agreed in sustaining the patent and 
"awarding an injunction to the Pullman Company, with "
"damages to be ascertained by a master, to whom the case "
was referred for this purpose. No appeal was prayed. 
"Instead, the -Wagner Company gave the Pullman Com "
pany a bond conditioned that it would pay the Pullman 
Company whatever damages the master might find it was 
entitled to. That there was utility in the Sessions device 
is conclusive from the statement at the time of Watson S. 
"Webb, president of the Wagner Company: ""We simply "
"must have it or abandon our trains."" "

"Benjamin F. Thurston, Offield and Towle, and Runnells "
"and Burry appeared for the Pullman Company, and George "
Payson and Coburn and Thacher for the Wagner Company. 
All except Runnells and Burry had (or years limited their 
practice to patent litigation. Benjamin F. Thurston was 
recognized as the ablest advocate of his time in his 
specialty. George Payson had for years been the chief 
adviser of the Western Railroad Association in all patent 
litigation and in all questions relating to patents that 
might affect railroads. The Western Railroad Association 
was composed of practically all the railroad corporations 



522 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

operating railroads west of Chicago. Coburn and Thacher 
were eminent in their specialty. 

The case was most ably and elaborately argued. The 
principal argument in support of the validity of the Sessions 
device was made by Mr. Thurston. Careful consideration 
"by the two judges in conference was give a to the testimony, "
which made a volume of a thousand printed pages. There 
"were exhibits and models. After the conclusion was reached, "
the opinion to justify the conclusion was prepared by 
Judge Gresham with the concurrence of Judge Blodgett. 
It was then held for a time to make any change that might 
occur on further reflection. During this time the manu 
"script was placed in my hands for safe keeping. Of course, "
I read it. It was as plain to me as the description my 
husband had written me of the oven the soldier had built 
"in his tent when in Kentucky in November, 1861. Besides, "
when it came to running a sewing machine and fixing it 
"when it got out of order, no woman could beat me at that. "

One day at noon the judges announced they would 
decide the case at 2 o clock of that day. After the case 
"was decided, Mr. John W. Doane, who was a great specu "
"lator and interested in Pullman stock, even if he was head "
"of a bank, said to me: "

That was an important decision of your husband s the 
"other day."" "

"Yes, I replied. ""I knew of it for days,"" "

Had you told me of it we could have made a lot of 
"money,"" said Mr. Doane. "

That is something that never happened through me - 
"a leak,"" I answered. "

Like many another woman whose position put her in 
the possession of information the knowledge of which 
"would be of great value to newspaper men and women, "
"men of affairs and speculators, I have been approached in "
various disguises to learn that of which it was natural to 
"suppose I was cognizant. But never once was I ""pumped."" "



PULLMAN PALACE CAR PATENT CASES 523 

"All other resources failing, like many another woman I "

have feigned that stupidity that left my interrogator under 

the impression I was the most ignorant woman on earth. 

The concluding portion of this opinion was as follows: 

It required more than mere mechanical skill to see that the 
pressure of the platform buffer springs could be made effective 
in vertical lines between the superstructures of the cars as well 
as in the longitudinal lines of the platforms. Sessions discovered 
a means whereby our long high American cars might be made 
"to run as steadily as the low short English cars, and the fact "
that for years his now simple device occurred to none of our 
many car builders is a circumstance strongly favoring the claim 
"that his invention possesses novelty. If his device, or anything "
"like it, and capable of producing the same useful results, was "
"known in the prior art, it is remarkable that its practical utility "
was not recognized sooner and understood. All prior buffing 
structures lacked what was necessary to give them the effective 
force that the Sessions elevated spring buffer plates are capable 
of exerting. We have already seen that the value of the Sessions 
improvement as a means of diminishing the force of shocks and 
"counteracting the tendency to sway when in motion, was promptly "
recognized by the principal railroads of the country ; while utility 
"is not conclusive proof of invention, it is strongly suggestive of "
"it. Owing to the differences between American and English cars, "
there was greater necessity for additional means of steadying 
"cars of the former class than of the latter, and yet no one sug "
gested the elevated buffer plates. The defendants are at liberty to 
"use the vestibule structure without the Sessions invention, as well as "
"all the various prior trifling devices, whether described in patents "
"or not, and yet they persist in asserting their right to use the Ses "
sions buffer plates while denouncing them as worthless. If they 
"are sincere in thus characterizing this improvement, why do they "
squander money in attaching it to their cars? Practical railroad 
men do not adopt and use devices that are of no value. 

This opinion upholding the Sessions patent was read 
"April 17, 1889. On May 13, 1887, sixteen days after the "
"application for the Sessions patent had been made, George "



524 LIFE OF WALTER QUINT IN G RE SHAM 

M. Pullman filed in the Patent Office his application for a 
vestibule connection for railway cars. Its chief factor was 
the Sessions device. In time Pullman came to claim that 
"his patent covered the Sessions device, and that he was the "
"inventor of it. But it was not until May 14, 1889, after "
"several rejections, many amendments, and one disclaimer, "
"that George W. Pullman was granted a patent, No. 403,137. "
This patent Mr. Pullman promptly assigned to the Pull 
man Company. The Patent Office seemed to see its way 
"clear to grant a patent on the combination of the vestibule, "
"which the opinion of April 17, i88g, had said was no novelty, "
with the Sessions device. 

"May 31, 1889, the Pullman Palace Car Company brought "
a suit in the Circuit Court of the Northern District of 
Illinois against the Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern Rail 
"road Company, and W. S. Webb as president of the Wagner "
"Palace Car Company; and on July 23 of the same year, "
the Pullman Company brought another suit against the 
Michigan Central Railroad Company and W. S. Webb as 
president of the Wagner Palace Car Company. In both 
"suits the prayer for relief was the same, an injunction "
against using the Pullman device as described in patent 
"No. 403,137. "

At this stage it will not take a patent lawyer to see that 
the Pullman patent was suggesting a cloud on the integrity 
"of the Sessions device. The law is, that a grant of letters "
patent from the government can run only to the patentee 
or his assignee. The application for the patent must be 
in the name of the patentee. If Pullman was the real 
"inventor, and not Sessions, a fraud had been committeed "
and the patent was void. 

Meantime a suit based on the Pullman patent had been 
commenced in the Circuit Court for the Eastern District 
of Massachusetts by the Pullman Company against the 
"Boston &amp; Albany Railroad Company and W. S. Webb, "
president of the Wagner Palace Car Company. 



PULLMAN PALACE CAR PATENT CASES 525 

"October, i8go, Judge Colt sustained the Pullman patent "
and issued an injunction against the Boston &amp; Albany 
Company and President Webb. Thereupon the Pullman 
"Company pressed its claim that, as a matter of comity, it "
was entitled to injunctions in the two suits still pending 
in the Northern District of Illinois. 

George Payson was one of the counsel who appeared 
before Judge Colt for the Wagner Company. Benjamin F. 
Thurston did not appear in that litigation for the Pullman 
"Company, and did not appear in the second hearing in "
"Chicago. The absence of Mr. Thurston, Judges Gresham "
and Blodgett construed as most significant. ; Thurston 
"does not uphold the new Pullman patent, and he abates "
not one jot or tittle of what he said in favor of the validity 
"of the Sessions device""- a man of honor before all else. "
Benjamin F. Thurston s obligation was to the court that 
"had followed his argument in the Sessions case, and to his "
profession and the truth. 

"On the announcement of Judge Colt s opinion, the spec "
"ulators sold the Pullman stock down, and Judge Colt s "
"brother, Colonel Richard Colt, who had loaded up with "
"Pullman stock, lost a large amount of money. "

"November n, 1890, after hearing the argument on the "
"Pullman Company for an injunction, the case was taken "
under advisement by Judges Gresham and Blodgett. 
"January 20, 1891, they made their decision, and again "
Judge Gresham wrote the opinion. After reciting what 
"had occurred in Judge Colt s court, the opinion proceeds: "

"Under the well-established rule of comity, the decree in the "
Boston case entitles the complainant to the injunction prayed 
"for, unless the court which rendered the decree gave a construc "
tion to the Sessions patent at variance with this court s construc 
tion of it. 

This court sustained the Sessions patent on the ground that 
the equalizing mechanism was capable of keeping the frame 
"plates in frictional contact, not part of the time, but all the time, "



526 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN G RE SHAM 

"on sharp curves like those of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Road, as well "
"as on tangents. . . . The complainant in that suit, the former "
suit before Judges Gresham and Blodgett (and the parties in that 
"and this suit are the same), insisted that this was the correct "
"construction of the Sessions patent. And yet, in the face of its "
"former ruling, this court is now asked to hold that the Sessions "
equalizing mechanism will not keep the frame plates in constant 
contact: that in turning curves the plates on the inner side will 
"touch only on the outer (inner) edges, while on the outer side of the "
"curve they will not, or may not, touch at all. . . . The same "
"solicitors prepared both patents and drawings; and, although "
"the latter are exactly alike, it is claimed that they were intended "
to represent two different equalizing deAices. The construction 
which Sessions now places upon his patent cannot be reconciled 
with his testimony in the Sessions suit. 

"Then the affidavit of George M. Pullman, which had "
been filed in the Sessions suit and used on the application 
"for the preliminary injunction in that case, was brought "
forward by the judges and commented on. No reference 
was made to it by the Wagner attorneys in the second suit. 

Part of the Pullman affidavit follows: 

These vertical spring buffers project beyond the vertical 
"planes of the cars, so that on the coupling of the two cars the "
adjacent frames of the cars compress the springs which back 
"them, and therefore the faces of the plates are held against each other "
in factional contact. The result of this construction is that the 
"tendency of the cars of a train, when running at high speed, to "
"have oscillations or vibrations set up, is almost entirely dissi "
pated. ... As an evidence of the steadiness with which trains 
"run, and their freedom from that oscillatory movement which "
belongs to all other descriptions of trains when running at high 
"speed, I will state that there is provided in one of the cars of the "
train a barber s room. The barber s chair in this room is daily 
occupied by persons who desire to be shaved upon the train ; and 
I state that there is but little more danger or risk in undergoing 
shaving at the hands of the barber with a common razor on this 
"train, when running at forty miles an hour, than there would be "
in an ordinary barber s shop in Chicago. I have found that the 



PULLMAN PALACE CAR PATENT CASES 527 

oscillation of the cars has become greatly diminished in conse 
"quence of the application of the spring friction plates in contact, "
interposed between the superstructures of adjacent cars of the 
"train, and that the upper berths of sleeping cars are no longer "
objectionable on account of the swaying movement. 

Then the opinion proceeds: 

"The Sessions patent, as we are now asked to construe it, "
would fall far short of accomplishing these beneficial results. In 
his original application Pullman claimed the vestibule and the 
bellows. He did not there claim what was finally allowed as the 
distinguishing feature of his patent. In none of his numerous 
original claims did he embrace the oscillating motion of the arch- 
plate and footplate. It may be fairly inferred that his first 
application was prepared with reference to the disclaimer of the 
vestibule and bellows in the Sessions application. His original 
"application and claims were all cancelled, and more than a year "
after the date of his first application he filed a new specification 
"and claims, and it was in these that he first claimed the equalizing "
"mechanism, with its motions and restraints of motions. This "
"application was rejected February 9, 1889, the commissioner "
holding that the applicant had not invented a single element; 
the particular equalizer being shown in the Janney and Sessions 
"patents, and the frame plate in the latter patent. .... Some "
"weeks later, the application, which had been rejected on the ground "
that the Sessions patent showed the frame plate and the partic 
"ular equalizer, was allowed, and the patent in suit issued. On "
"April i, 1889, Pullman made and forwarded his affidavit to the "
"Patent Office, in which he stated that he had reduced his inven "
tion to practice on a train of cars before Sessions filed his appli 
"cation. Some weeks later, the application, which had been re "
jected on the ground that the Sessions patent showed the frame 
"plate and the particular equalizer, was allowed, and the patent "
in suit issued. The affidavit did not say that Pullman was the 
"first inventor, and it did not follow that, because he first "
"reduced the invention to practice, he, and not Sessions, first "
perfected the invention. It did not deny that the Sessions patent 
"showed the particular equalizer ; on the contrary, its presenta "
tion amounted to an acquiescence in the correctness of the 

34



528 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"commissioners ruling on that point, and a claim that Pullman "
was entitled to a patent because he was the first inventor. 

We have referred to the fact that the parties to this suit 
were the litigants in the Sessions suit. In the latter suit the 
complainant obtained a decree on the theory that Sessions was 
the first inventor of the equalizing mechanism for which a patent 
was finally granted to Pullman. That decree remains in force. 
It is chiefly on the testimony of Sessions in this suit and the 
Boston suit that this court is now asked to hold that he was not 
the first inventor. That testimony cannot be reconciled with 
material portions of the testimony of the same witness in the 
"Sessions suit. To what extent, if at all, the decree in the Sessions "
suit is conclusive upon the complainant in this suit is a question 
which we prefer to reserve until the final hearing. Injunction 
denied. 

There was perturbation from which Mr. Pullman and 
his lawyers never recovered. Newspaper editions contain 
ing that last decision were bought up and destroyed. The 
opportunity that was thus given the Wagner Company 
and the secret committee of patent lawyers who represent 
ed the railroads of the country the Vanderbilt interests 
"including Chauncey M. Depew, who had criticized the "
opinion in the Sessions suit to question the cloud that 
"George M. Pullman had put on the Sessions patent, was "
not taken advantage of. The Pullman and Wagner com 
panies settled all their differences and consolidated under 
the name of the Pullman Company. Railroad men who had 
assailed the Sessions patent bought stock in the Pullman 
"Company. Never again did a Pullman lawyer, a Wagner "
"lawyer, or a lawyer for the Western Railroad Association "
enter the United States Circuit Court for the Northern 
District of Illinois in the lost Pullman-Wagner case. The 
case stood as it did the day the preliminary injunction 
"was denied, January 20, 1891, until April 30, 1900, when "
on the general call of the docket no one appeared either for 
the Pullman or the Wagner Company or for the Govern 
"ment, and the suit was dismissed for want of prosecution. "



PULLMAN PALACE CAR PATENT CASES 529 

The fact that the defendants and the patent attorneys for 
the Western Railroad Association did not avail themselves 
of the court s offer to re-litigate the validity of the Sessions 
"patent, suggests two inferences: one that the second suits "
were collusively framed between the Pullman and Wagner 
"companies, as often happens when two combinations are "
fighting for a patent when one is defeated in the first 
"instance, instead of continuing the contest, they unite and "
"endeavor to extend the monopoly thus obtained; second, "
"the judgment in the first suit, supported as it was by the "
"opinion in that case, and Thurston s absence from the second "
"suit, could not be overthrown. In legal ability and knowl "
edge of patents Judge Blodgett was without a superior on 
the Federal bench.

JUSTICE HARLAN HIS DECISION. 

T CAME to know Mrs. Angle after she had secured a 
* judgment in an action at law before a jury and Walter 
"Q. Gresham as the trial judge, in the United States Circuit "
"Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, and while "
she was seeking to enforce that judgment or redress on the 
"equity side of that court, in the Supreme Court of the "
United States and the United States Court of Appeals for 
the Seventh Circuit. I saw her in Washington when Gen

to argue her case. I saw her in Chicago after the court of 
"equity the guardian of the infant, the orphan, and the "
"widow had turned her out penniless, and confirmed as "
"a gift, in consideration of the construction of a railroad, "
"timber lands worth $2,000,000 to a railroad corporation. "
Towards the construction of this railroad a jury found her 
"husband, H. C. Angle, had contributed $341,000. Justice "

"Harlan reduced this amount to $200,000. Small and del "
"icate, she possessed the courage and fortitude of the tigress, "
"and although broken in health at the end, claimed she had "
"proved Sledon s saying, ""Equity is a roguish thing."" "

"In impoverishing herself, Sarah R. Angle laid bare a "
"condition of affairs that helped, together with other dis "
"closures, to bring about reforms in the executive, legislative, "
and judicial branches of the government. Tried under the 
shadow of the Wisconsin University and the dome of the 
"State Capitol, the case had the widest publicity. For a "
time the public mind was assuaged by the report that 
"was deftly circulated, that after the courts of equity had "
"turned the widow from their door, the corporations had "
granted her a competency for life. Of course this report 
was untrue. 

The gibes and sarcasm of the English poets and philo 
"sophers helped develop the chancellor s conscience. ""In "
"law we have a measure, but in equity it is like the chancel "
"lor s foot. It is long or short, according to the man, and "
"then it is not always the same in the same man."" "

Stripped of legal verbiage and technical descriptions of 
"lands, the following is the case: By Acts of Congress of "
"June 4, 1856, and May 5, 1864, 400,000 acres of timber land "
were granted to the State of Wisconsin to aid in the con 
struction of a railroad running northwest from St. Croix 
"River or Lake to Lake Superior, about sixty-five miles in "
"length, with the proviso, however, that if the railroad was "
"not completed within a period of ten years, the land "
should revert to the United States. At that time it was 
not the policy of the executive branch of the government of 
the United States to insist on forfeitures of land grants 
"made to aid in the construction of railroads, if the con "
struction was not completed within the time limit. Until 
"the executive branch of the government acted, the Supreme "
Court had held that the limitations in the land grants 
Congress made to the States to aid in the construction of 



532 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

railroads were not self-acting. So long as the executive de 
"partment did not say, ""Your time has expired,"" the license "
"to the State ""and its grantee"" to build the railroad and "
earn the land grant continued. 

"By an act of the Wisconsin legislature of March 20, "
"1865, and by subsequent acts, the State of Wisconsin con "
"veyed these lands to the Chicago, Portage &amp; Superior Rail "
"road Company, hereinafter called the Portage Company, "
"and gave it until May 2, 1882, to complete the St. Croix "
Railroad. The Portage Company contemplated a line to 
"Chicago, and to that end gave a mortgage to the Farmers "
"Loan &amp; Trust Company to secure an issue of $1,000,000, "
with the proceeds of which it expected to construct the 
Portage and Chicago line. Only a small portion of these 
bonds had been issued when the panic of 1873 stopped their 
sale and suspended practically all railroad construction. 

"The revival of business came in 1879 and 1880, and "
"on August i, 1 88 1, the Portage Company entered into a "
written contract w r ith H. C. Angle to construct the sixty- 
five miles of railroad of the St. Croix line. The lowest 
"value that was ever placed on the timber on the 400,000 "
"acres granted for the construction of this line was $2,000,- "
ooo. Angle had had large experience as a railroad con 
tractor and was a man of means. 

"At this time, and for several years prior thereto, the "
"Chicago, Minneapolis, St. Paul &amp; Omaha Railroad Com "
"pany, hereinafter called the Omaha Company, was a rail "
road corporation operating more than a thousand miles of 
"railroad in the States of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Ne "
braska. It had been favored in the construction of its line 
by grants of government lands. Henry H. Porter of Chicago 
"was its president; Philetus Sawyer of Oshkosh, Wisconsin, "
one of the United States senators from the State of Wis 
"consin, our old neighbor and friend in Washington, was a "
member of its Board of Directors and its vice-president; 
"John C. Spooner, its general counsel, resided in the St. "



"is ""EQUITY A ROGUISH THING?"" 533 "

"Croix neighborhood, at Hudson, Wisconsin. The state of "
public morals in Wisconsin was such at that time that 
Mr. Spooner could be at the same time a lobbyist and a 
"successful candidate for the United States Senate, to which he "
"was elected January 15, 1885. Later a change came over the "
"public, if not over the judicial conscience, and with it came "
Mr. Spooner s retirement from the United States Senate. 
One of the contributing causes to both results was Mr. 
Spooner s connection with this celebrated Angle case. 

"The Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad Company, "
"hereinafter called the St. Paul Company, was another Wis "
consin railroad corporation owning a great railroad originat 
"ing at Milwaukee, extending to Chicago, and from Mil "
waukee through the Northwestern States adjacent to Wis 
consin now running to the Pacific Coast. Alexander 
"Mitchell, its president, and John W. Cary, its general coun "
"sel, resided at Milwaukee. "

Both the Omaha and St. Paul companies had long 
"looked with covetous eyes upon those 400,000 acres of "
valuable timber lands and the line to Duluth and Superior 
"via St. Croix, and many were the attempts prior to 1881 to "
wrest them from the Portage Company. When the Omaha 
attorneys in the Wisconsin legislature in those days it 
was the practice for the corporations to have attorneys on 
"their payrolls in all the legislatures, even in the national "
Congress would introduce a bill to revoke the grant to 
the Portage Company and confer it on the Omaha Com 
"pany, the attorneys for the St. Paul Company in the legis "
lature would object and the bill would not pass. When the 
St. Paul Company s attorneys attempted to pass a like 
"measure, the Omaha s attorneys would block them. "

"After Angle entered into his contract of August i, "
"1 88 1, with the Portage Company, he vigorously prosecuted "
the work of constructing the sixty-five miles of railroad. 
He made great progress during the fall of that year. But 
"in order to do so, he was forced to pledge his individual "



534 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"property and credit. That 400,000 acres of valuable timber "
"land, the title to which would vest absolutely in the Portage "
"Company on the completion of the line, seemed to justify "
this action on Angle s part. That the Omaha might buy 
off the St. Paul Company and part of the officers of the 
"Portage Company, tie the hands of the balance with an "
"injunction, and then secure the approval of all the judges "
"except one who came in contact with the case, was not "
considered within the range of possibilities. 

John C. Spooner later testified that in the very last days 
"of December, 1881, or the first days of January, 1882, he "
met Angle at the Grand Pacific Hotel in Chicago. From 
"Angle, Spooner learned that the Portage Company was "
"financially embarrassed, that it was not meeting its payments "
"to Angle, who was advancing his own money to carry on "
"the construction, and was making desperate efforts, al "
"though hard pressed, in the dead of winter, to comply with "
his contract with the Portage Company. All these facts 
Mr. Spooner said he forthwith laid before President H. H. 
"Porter of the Omaha Company, with the following advice: "
That the Portage Company had forfeited the grant of the 
land on the St. Croix-Superior line because it had not con 
"structed another line, namely, that between Portage and "
"Chicago, and that the way for the Omaha or Porter s "
Company to get the land grant would be to have the legis 
"lature, when it met on January n, 1882, revoke the grant "
to the Portage Company and confer it upon the Omaha 
"Company, although under the existing acts of the Wis "
"consin legislature, as we have seen, that grant did not "
"expire until May 2, 1882. "

"In the equity suit, President Porter of the Omaha "
Company testified that he accepted Mr. Spooner s advice 
as sound and proceeded to act on it. But eminently prac 
tical and fearing another contest with the St. Paul Com 
"pany before the Wisconsin legislature, Mr. Porter said he "
"first went to Milwaukee and there, on the loth of January, "



"is ""EQUITY A ROGUISH THING?"" 535 "

"1882, entered into a written contract with Alexander "
"Mitchell, as president and on behalf of the St. Paul Com "
"pany, stipulating that if it, the St. Paul Company, not "
only would abstain from opposing the Wisconsin legislature 
from revoking the grant to the Portage Company and con 
"ferring it upon the Omaha Company, but on the contrary, "
"by its officers, agents, and attorneys, would aid the Omaha "
Company in securing the revocation and confirmation of 
"the grant to the Omaha Company, that the Omaha Com "
pany would give the St. Paul Company one-fourth of the 
land grant and a trackage right over the sixty-five miles 
"of railroad when completed, on a fair and equitable basis. "
Senator Philetus Sawyer and Mr. Mitchell were named 
in this contract as the arbitrators to determine any con 
troversies that might arise between the two companies as 
"to the distribution, as one man said, of the ""sw r ag."" "

At the same time that Porter opened his negotiations 
with the St. Paul Company he also went after the Portage 
Company. At this time Charles J. Barnes of Chicago was 
and had long been a director of the Portage Company and 
"claimed to represent himself and his uncle, A. S. Barnes of "
"New York. A. A. Jackson cf Janesville, Wisconsin, was "
also a director and since 1872 had been general solicitor of 
the Portage Company. Before the Wisconsin legislature he 
had helped secure fox- the Portage Company the St. Croix 
"grant, and in the season of 1881, with the aid of John C. "
"Spooner and others, he had prevented the St. Paul Com "
"pany from revoking the grant of the Portage Company, "
and confirming it in the St. Paul Company. All that the 
"Portage Company owed, except the few bonds secured by "
"the mortgage to the Farmers Loan &amp; Trust Company, "
the proceeds of which had gone into the construction of 
"the Portage and Chicago line, and the indebtedness it had "
"incurred to Angle on the St. Croix line, was $18,000 to "
"Jackson, $2,000 to I. C. Stone, an attorney of Madison who "
"had helped Jackson before the Wisconsin legislature, and "



536 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"$10,000 to Edward Ruger of Janesville, Wisconsin, for "
engineering services. Forty thousand dollars would cover 
all the two Barnes s had contributed to the enterprise. 
"Eighty thousand dollars, Jackson said, in his testimony, "
"would reimburse himself, the two Barnes s, Stone, and "
Ruger. 

At this time the Portage Company had outstanding 
"$2,000,000 par value of stock in the name of Charles J. "
"Barnes. One million was to reimburse and secure Barnes, "
"Jackson, Ex-Governor Schofield and others for their ad "
vances to the Portage Company. The other million was 
merely held by Barnes to dispose of to raise money for the 
"company. In short, as to the last million, at least, Barnes "
was only a trustee. 

"January 20, 1882, the Omaha Company, represented by "
"H. H. Porter and John C. Spooner, entered into a contract "
"in the name of Ransom R. Cable, one of its directors, with "
Charles J. Barnes and A. A. Jackson for the purchase of 
"$2,000,000 of the capital stock of the Portage Company "
"standing in Barnes s name, for the sum of $200,000, pro "
vided the Omaha Company succeeded in wresting the St. 
Croix land grant from the Portage Company. Should the 
"legislation fail, then Jackson and Barnes bound themselves "
"to sell for a song. Of this $2,000,000 of Portage stock, "
H. H. Porter testified that at the time he purchased it 
"through Cable it had no market value and was worthless, "
except as it could be made a means of annoyance 

In the case of Oscanyan vs. Arms Howe Company (103 
"U. S. 261), decided in 1881, the Supreme Court of the United "
States said: 

Bribes in the shape of high contingent compensation must 
necessarily lead to the use of improper means and the exercise 
of unlawful influence. 

This Oscanyan case rests on the scoring Chief Justice 
Taney gave one Marshall who was suing the Baltimore &amp; 
Ohio Railroad Company for compensation for lobbying 



"is ""EQUITY A ROGUISH THING?"" 537 "

through the Virginia legislature a bill to give the Baltimore 
"&amp; Ohio Company, which was a Maryland corporation, the "
right to build its line through Virginia to the Ohio River. 
What particularly aroused the ire of the Chief Justice in 
"speaking for the entire court (Marshall vs. B. &amp; O. R. R. Co., "
"1 6 Howard 341), was Marshall s advice to the Baltimore "
Company in a letter which the Company preserved and 
"used in defending the suit: ""Give them nothing if they "
"fail, endow them richly if they succeed."" "

After the revocation of the land grant to the Portage 
Company and the completion of the railroad by the Omaha 
"Company, the St. Paul Company called on the Omaha Com "
"pany for its one-fourth of the 400,000 acres of timber land "
and for its trackage right over the constructed sixty-two 
"miles of railroad. ""Oh, no,"" said the Omaha Company, by "
"John C. Spooner and S. U. Pinney, ""you blackmailed us "
"into entering into that contract, which, as a matter of law, "
is void because it is manifestly corrupt and unlawful in its 
"tendency, irrespective of the question whether anything "
wrong was intended or accomplished that was either im 
"proper or illegal."" "

"To enforce this contract, the St. Paul Company, Sep "
"tember 7, 1883, brought its suit in the Circuit Court of Dane "
"County, Wisconsin, sitting at Madison, which held the con "
"tract valid. But on appeal, the Supreme Court of Wis "
"consin (75 Wis. 224), resting its conclusion on Section 4482 "
of the Wisconsin statutes and the two opinions of the 
Supreme Court of the United States to which we have just 
"referred, on the 3d day of December, 1899, sustained the "
"contention of the Omaha Company, that the contract was "
"corrupt and immoral, and therefore void. "

"January 23, 1882, the bill drafted by John C. Spooner "
revoking the grant to the Portage Company and conferring 
it on the Omaha Company was simultaneously introduced 
in both houses of the Wisconsin legislature. Contempo 
raneous therewith the manager of the Portage Company 



538 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

ordered in the Portage s engineering corps under whose 
"supervision Angle with 1,700 men in the wilds of Wisconsin "
"in midwinter, as John C. Spooner said, was prosecuting the "
construction of the sixty-five miles of road. Immediately 
attachments were levied by supply men and boarding-house 
keepers on Angle s tools and personal property. Laborers 
"clamored for their pay and threatened violence in Duluth, "
whose citizens telegraphed Governor Rusk to send troops 
"to preserve the peace. Jeremiah H. Rusk, as a member of "
"the Sawyer-Spooner regime, inaugurated for the first time "
"Governor of Wisconsin on the 26. day of January, 1882, "
afterwards said his answer to the citizens of Duluth was: 
"These men want bread, not bayonets. "

The stories of Governor Rusk and Senator Spooner agree 
as to what then happened. Within a few days after the 
"bill was introduced, and before the bill had passed either "
"house, Governor Rusk called in Senator Spooner and noti "
fied him in advance that the bill passing either house he 
could not sign it unless some provision was made for the 
payment of the laborers who were then destitute in the 
wilds of Wisconsin. On the theory there was no obliga 
"tion on the State to do so, Mr. Spooner said, ""I told the "
Governor I would report to Mr. Porter and take his instruc 
"tions."" Accordingly Mr. Spooner went to Chicago, re "
"ported to Mr. Porter, and received Mr. Porter s consent to "
"pay out $78,000, $75,000 of it to be applied in part payment "
"of the laborers and supply claims, and $3,000 to be used "
by the State in bearing its expenses in making the distri 
bution. Mr. Spooner says he reported to the Governor 
"what Porter had said to him, and also that he would not "
assume for the Omaha Company the payment of any other 
of the obligations of the Portage Company to contractors 
and subcontractors. 

"And thereupon on the i6th day of February, 1882, "
"Governor Rusk signed the bill, amended as Mr. Porter "
"desired, limiting the liability of the Omaha Company to "



"is ""EQUITY A ROGUISH THING?"" 539 "

";,ooo and cutting out Angle. Here it was, the Governor "
"afterwards said, John C. Spooner ""put it over"" on him, and "
offered to advance $50.000 if that should be necessary to 
help Robert M. LaFoltette put Spooner out of the United 
States Senate. But in those formative days General Rusk 
"thought his old army comrade of the Army of the Tennessee, "
"as the trial judge in the Angle case, did not have the regard "
for the executive and legislative that should obtain under 
our separate and independent departments of government. 

Governor Rusk s biographer attempts to justify the 
Governor s course by showing that he forced the Omaha 
Company to pay the laborers the back wages the Portage 
"Company owed them. Why, then, in law, morals, and "
"equity, said Walter Q. Gresham, did not the Governor force "
"the Omaha Company to reimburse Angle, the contractor, "
"the $341,000 (part of which liquidated pay rolls) that Angle "
had expended on the partly constructed railroad before the 
land grant on which that partly constructed railroad was 
turned over to the Omaha Company and which the Omaha 
"Company completed December i, 1882? "

"On the 2d day of February, 1882, Angle brought his "
suit in the United States Circuit Court for the Western 
"District of Wisconsin at Madison, against the Portage "
"Company for $750,000 damages sustained by him by reason "
"of the breach of the contract of August 18, 1881, in that it "
"had not made cash payments to him as the work progressed, "
"as the contract provided, and in the event he should fail "
"on that theory, to recover the value of the work he had "
"performed on the sixty-five miles of railroad, and on the "
"3d day of February, 1882, he brought in the same court his "
"suit in attachment in aid and levied on the 400,000 acres "
of the land grant timber lands. 

"And this was the way Ex-Governor Schofield, the presi "
"dent of the Portage Company, who claimed he had an inter "
"est in the stock standing in Barnes s name, was rounded up. "

"February 8, 1882, in the Circuit Court of Cook county, "



540 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"Illinois, at Chicago, Ransom R. Cable, as plaintiff in a suit "
"that day brought by Charles M. Osborne, an eminent "
"member of the Chicago bar, secured, without notice, an "
"injunction against Schofield, as president, and the Portage "
"Company, from issuing any further stock or bonds or mak "
ing any transfer of any stock already issued. At this time 
the Grand Trunk Railroad Company of Canada was con 
sidering the purchase of all of the stocks and bonds of 
the Portage Company. The other officers and directors of 
the Portage Company were left free to act. In this bill it 
was set up that Cable was then the sole owner of all the 
"valid stock of the Portage Company then outstanding, but "
as to how Cable acquired it not a word was said. There 
was not a reference to that remarkable contract of January 
"20, 1882. As a matter of fact, Cable did not and never had "
owned a dollar of Portage stock. 

Charles J. Barnes became surety on the injunction bond 
Cable was required to give under the agreement of the 
Omaha Company to indemnify him. As soon as there 
"was notice of this injunction, the Grand Trunk Company "
withdrew from the scheme and the collapse of the Portage 
Company was complete. 

"March 7, 1883, the legislature of Wisconsin confirmed "
"the Act of February 16, 1882, in the face of the claim that "
it was void and unconstitutional because the grant to the 
"Portage Company did not expire until May i, 1882. "

These acts of the Wisconsin legislature Walter Q. 
"Gresham held did not debar Angle s suit, on the law side, "
"and neither, whether corruptly or uncorruptly passed, did "
he believe they should have that effect on the equity side 
of the court. 

"August 6, 1882, H. C. Angle died in Chicago as the result "
"of his financial misfortunes, and Sarah R. Angle, his wife, "
was appointed administratrix of his estate by the Probate 
"Court of Cook County, Illinois, and was substituted as "
"plaintiff in his suits. The Angles were New York people, "
but when the construction work on the Portage Railroad 



"is ""EQUITY A ROGUISH THING?"" 541 "

"was begun, they had taken up their residence in Chicago. "

"By December i, 1882, the Omaha Company having "
completed the construction of the railroad from St. Croix 
"Lake to Superior on Lake Superior, H. H. Porter sold out "
his holding of stock in the Omaha Company to the Chicago 
"&amp; Northwestern Railroad Company, the control of which "
had previously been acquired by the Vanderbilt interests. 
"Porter retired as president of the Omaha Company, but "
Senator Philetus Sawyer continued as a director and as 
"one of its vice-presidents. Senator Sawyer, as we have "
"seen, sustained Walter Q. Gresham when as Postmaster- "
General he incurred the wrath of the Louisiana Lottery 
"people, and most cordial were our relations. But the "
Senator thought the judge was all wrong in so guiding the 
"proceedings in a law suit, as to lay the foundation for an "
attack on one of the Senator s favorite railroad corporations 
and on his official integrity. 

Angle s attachment suit was heard before Judge Bunn 
"from September 9 to 15, 1884, then taken under advise "
"ment and the attachment vacated and discharged April 13, "
1885. Judge Bunn thought the Sawyer-Spooner- Vanderbilt 
combination in Wisconsin would support Judge Gresham 
for President. Judge Gresham was of a different opinion. 

"January 14, 1887, the Angle case against the Portage "
Company for the breach of contract came on for trial at 
Madison before a jury and Circuit Judge Gresham as the 
trial judge. 

"Mrs. Angle was represented by Francis J. Lamb, B. W. "
"Jones of the Madison bar, ex-Senator James R. Doolittle "
"of Chicago, and General Charles Ewing, then of New "
"York, where he had taken up the practice of the law after "
he had failed as the Democratic candidate for the governor 
ship of Ohio. The Portage Company was represented 
by Silas U. Pinney and A. L. Sanborn of the Madison 
"bar, and Charles M. Osborne. Mr. Sanborn subsequently "
became the United States district judge for the Western 



542 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"District of Wisconsin, and Mr. Pinney a member of the "
Wisconsin Supreme Court. 

Mr. Osborne was sent to Madison by the Omaha Com 
"pany, expressly charged with the duty of making its de "
"fense. He it was who had in February, 1882, tied up the "
"Portage Company in the Circuit Court of Cook County, "
"Illinois, as Messrs. Porter and Spooner, in behalf of the "
"Omaha Company, were getting ready to cause the Wisconsin "
legislature to wrest the land grant from the Portage Com 
"pany. Mr. Osborne, in character, learning, and ability the "
"peer of any man at the bar, was one of Walter Q. Gres- "
ham s especial friends. There were other things than good 
fees that Charles M. Osborne valued. In addition to pay 
"ing Mr. Osborne, the Omaha Company compensated the "
other attorneys and bore all the expenses of the trial. 

"In his opening statement to the court and jury, Mr. "
Osborne claimed the Omaha Company had done nothing 
it was not in law justified in doing; that it was right for 
the Omaha Company to buy the stock of the Portage Com 
pany under the conditions and circumstances in which it 
"made the purchases, and then ""prick the bubble."" It is "
due to him as a lawyer to say that in this he w r as finally 
"sustained by the Supreme Court of the United States, but "
not by the trial judge. Mr. Osborne claimed there could 
"be no recovery in any event under the law, even against "
the Portage Company. The act of the legislature in revok 
ing the grant to the Portage Company and conferring it 
"on the Omaha Company was conclusive. And then, acting "
"on the theory that it was the best way to defend, Mr. "
"Osborne stated, ""We will show that Angle was guilty of "
fraud in inducing the Portage Company to enter into the 
"contract of August 16, 1881, with him, in that he had "
"agreed to give Schofield, the president of the Portage Com "
"pany, one-half of the profits that would be realized on the "
"construction of the sixty-five miles of road,"" and in order "
"that the ""swag"" might be large, ""the compensation agreed "



"is EQUITY A ROGUISH THING?"" 543 "

to be paid Angle was unreasonably high beyond what was 
"usual for such work."" All of Mr. Osborne s contentions "
except the charge of fraud against Angle were swept aside. 
Because the trial judge denounced from the bench the right 
"of the Omaha Company to ""prick the bubble,"" Mr. Osborne "
and his associates flinched and refused to produce the con 
"tract of January 20, 1882, and it was not until the trial "
judge threatened to send S. U. Pinney and A. A. Jackson 
to jail for contempt of court that this extraordinary per 
fectly-proper contract was produced in court. With inter 
"missions for Sundays, the trial lasted at Madison until "
"January 30, when the jury returned a verdict for Mrs. "
"Angle, assessing her damages at $351,965 . 50 over and above "
"a credit of $132,205 .65. Before leaving Madison there was "
"a judgment on the verdict for its full amount, subject to "
"motion for a new trial, which was promptly made by Mr. "
Osborne and his associates. 

The grounds urged for the new trial were the errors of 
the trial judge in rejecting all the special defenses above 
enumerated except that of fraud on Angle s part; errors 
"in admitting and rejecting evidence on this one question, "
and the instruction to the jury on it. Especially was the 
"use of the word ""clear,"" in connection with the words pre "
"ponderance of the evidence,"" criticized, ""because,"" said Mr. "
"Osborne, ""that word made the verdict."" This portion of "
the charge to the jury fellows: 

If you believe from the evidence that Schofield and Gaylord 
"were interested with Angle in the construction contract, and were "
entitled to share with him any of the profits which might be 
"derived from it, then the contract was fraudulent and there can "
"be no recovery on it. Schofield and Gaylord, as directors and "
"officers of the company, were bound to use their best endeavors "
"to promote its welfare, and the law would not permit them to "
"deal with themselves, and thus profit at the expense of those "
"whom they represented, which they did if the charge in the "
answer is correct. 



544 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

And if an agreement existed whereby Schofield and Gaylord 
"were to be benefited as stated, and yet you find in awarding the "
"contract to Angle, they were not influenced by their interest in "
"it, it is nevertheless fraudulent and void. "

"It is sufficient to render the contract invalid, that Schofield "
"and Gaylord, or either of them, as stockholders and officers of "
"the company, secured an agreement with the contractor to profit "
personally at the expense of the company. 

"You must not forget, however, that the burden is upon the "
"defendant to show, by a clear preponderance of the evidence, that "
the contract was fraudulent. The law indulges in no presump 
tion against the good faith of the officers of the company or against 
"the validity of the contract. On the contrary, the presumption "
"is that the officers acted honestly, and that the contract is free "
"from fraud, and unless upon a fair consideration of all the evidence "
you think there is a preponderance in support of the charge of 
"fraud, you will sustain the contract. Nothing short of an agree "
"ment or understanding that Schofield and Gaylord, or one of them, "
"was to have a share in the profits of the contract, is sufficient to "
render it invalid. Mere talk of such an agreement or under 
standing would not render the contract void if the parties really 
came to no understanding or agreement. 

"It was to the words, ""dear preponderance of the evi "
"dence,"" that Mr. Osborne especially objected. The word "
clear was more than the law allowed. 

The motion for a new trial was deferred from time to 
time until finally Justice Harlan could come to Chicago 
"and hear it, sitting with the circuit judge. There was an "
"extended argument on June 20, 1887. Justice Harlan de "
"livered an oral opinion, which went into the bill of excep "
tions. After adverting to the rule of the Supreme Court 
"of the United States, where there was a clear conflict in "
"the testimony on a controverted point, that a case should "
"never be withdrawn from a jury, he said: "

I have carefully examined the charge given by the circuit 
judge upon that and other questions in the case and am of the 
opinion that the charge contains no error. The only ground 



"is ""EQUITY A ROGUISH THING?"" 545 "

"entitled, it seems to me, to consideration, on that branch of the "
"case, is the objection made to the sentence in the charge of the "
"court in which the phrase, ""clear preponderance of the testimony "" "
"is found. Counsel for the company seize upon the word ""clear"" "
"in that connection, and argue that the jury were required to find "
more than the law required them to find in order to come to the 
conclusion that the contract was fraudulent; but that sentence 
is to be taken in connection with what follows : 

"Taking all the sentences together, the jury could not have "
understood the court to mean more than that which the court 
had a right to say that before imputing fraud to any one the 
"evidence must be of such a character as to satisfy the jury, reason "
"ably, that such was the fact. The words, ""clear preponderance "
"of testimony,"" in the connection in which they are used, mean "
"no more than a preponderance of testimony. I do not think, "
"therefore, that error can be laid against that part of the charge "
of the court. It is hardly necessary to go over other portions of 
the charge to which exception was taken. I am satisfied that the 
scales of justice were held very evenly balanced throughout 
the trial. 

It struck me at the time the case was opened that the recovery 
"was rather an extraordinary one, larger than the facts justified, "
to be attributed in part to the natural feeling that jurors would 
have at the injustice which it was proposed to do the contractor 
I have no doubt largely due to the argument of counsel who closed 
the case before the jury. 

"We are of the opinion that, upon any fair view of the evidence, "
"the verdict is in excess of the fair amount by $146,745. The "
motion for a new trial I recommend to the circuit judge - 1 say 
"recommend for I did not hear the witnesses, and the order should "
"more properly come, I think, from the judge who tried the case "
"will be denied, provided the plaintiff shall, within ten days, remit "
"from the verdict $146,745, and in default of their so doing, the "
verdict will be set aside and a new trial ordered. 

"Such an order will be entered, said Judge Gresham. "

"Mrs. Angle remitted $146,745 from the judgment. "
"Mr. Osborne, on behalf of the Portage Company, but in "
the interest of the Omaha Company for he was in its 



546 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

pay presented a bill of exceptions which showed every 
step in the case down to over-ruling the motion for the new 
"trial and the remitter, which was signed by the trial judge "
and filed in the office of the clerk of the United States 
Circuit Court at Madison. From the order over-ruling the 
motion for the new trial the Portage Company sued out 
and lodged with the clerk of the Supreme Court at Wash 
"ington a writ of error, that is, a complete transcript of all "
that had occurred in the jury trial and dow r n to the over 
ruling of the motion for the new trial. To the Supreme 
Court the Portage Company said in this writ of error that 
Judge Gresham and Justice Harlan had erred in entering 
the judgment for Mrs. Angle. But the Portage Company 
"did not make this writ of error a supersedeas; that is, it did "
"not give a bond conditioned, if it dismissed the writ before "
"the Supreme Court passed on it, or if the Supreme Court "
"sustained the judgment, that it would pay the judgment. "
Such a bond would have stayed an execution on the judg 
ment. The bond the Portage Company gave was con 
ditioned only to pay Mrs. Angle the costs she might be put 
"to in the Supreme Court. It was in the penalty of $1,000. "
And after a line was obtained on what would be the view 
of the judges on the equity side of the court to which they 
knew Mrs. Angle would have to resort in order to enforce her 
"judgment against the 400,000 acres of land then in the "
"possession of the Omaha Company, the writ of error was "
dismissed. 

"No property found, being the return on the execu "
"tion against the Portage Company, Sarah R. Angle filed "
her bill against the Omaha Company on the equity side 
of the United States Circuit Court for the Western District 
"of Wisconsin at Madison. In this bill she set up, in prop "
"er legal verbiage, the facts we have recited, expressly al "
leging that the Omaha Company had practiced bribery and 
corruption on the Wisconsin legislature. In truth and in 
"fact, it was the act of the Omaha Company operating "



"is ""EQUITY A ROGUISH THING?"" 547 "

"through the Wisconsin legislature that secured the property, "
"400,000 acres of land with its $2,000,000 worth of valu "
able timber on it and bettered by the partially constructed 
railroad that Angle had built. Because of its wrongs the 
Omaha Company held this property as a trustee for the 
"benefit of the creditors of the Portage Company, especially "
"the widow of the contractor, Angle, and therefore was lia "
ble to have these lands and the proceeds of such of them 
"as had been sold, subjected to the payment of Mrs. Angle s "
judgment. 

The bill concluded with the old English jurisdictional 
"formula: ""In tender consideration whereof, as your ora- "
trix is remediless in the premises by the strict rules of the 
"common law, and is only relievable in a court of equity, "
"where matters of this kind are properly cognizable, your "
"oratrix prays . . . . "" "

"To this bill the Omaha Company promptly demurred, "
"that is, it said Mrs. Angle was not entitled to relief in a "
court of equity. 

"Contemporaneously with the filing of Mrs. Angle s bill, "
"the Farmers Loan &amp; Trust Company, trustee under the "
mortgage heretofore spoken of which the Portage Company 
"had executed several years before, filed against the Portage "
and Omaha companies its bill on the equity side of the 
United States Circuit Court for the Western District of 
"Wisconsin, on the same theory and on the same facts that "
Mrs. Angle set forth in her bill. This bill was even stronger 
than Mrs. Angle s in charging bribery and corruption on 
the part of the Omaha Company. 

But instead of demurring to the Farmers Loan &amp; Trust 
"Company s bill, the Omaha Company by answer relied on "
"the acts of the Wisconsin legislature, and denied there was "
"any bribery, fraud, undue influence, or deceit practised by "
it in securing the passage of that legislation. Evidence 
was taken on both sides. Both cases were heard together 
"by Justice Harlan, while on the circuit at Madison, in June, "



548 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

1889. Charles M. Osborne was still the chief counsel for 
the Omaha Company. 

"On July 10, 1889, Justice Harlan announced his con "
clusions in an elaborate opinion. He came right up to the 
dead line. The proof was ample that corruption and im 
proper influences on the part of the Omaha Company caused 
the legislature of Wisconsin to revoke the grant to the 
"Portage Company and confer it on the Omaha Company, "
"and invalid as was the act of February 16, 1882, it broke "
the credit of the Portage Company; still the act of con 
"firmation was an act of the legislature, binding on a Federal "
"court, sitting as a court of equity. Therefore he turned "
"out of court the Farmers Loan &amp; Trust Company, on its "
"proofs, and Mrs. Angle on the allegations of her bill. "

The Supreme Court reversed Justice Harlan at first in 
the Angle case and then sustained him. But in finally 
"turning Mrs. Angle out of court, Justice Brewer, as the "
"spokesman of the Supreme Court, made no mention of "
"the testimony of Porter and Spooner, of the decision of the "
Supreme Court of Wisconsin condemning as immoral the 
"contract of January 20, 1882, and the former decisions of "
the Supreme Court of the United States on which the Wis 
consin court in part rested its conclusion. Still they would 
go behind the legislative act. But in order to do so they 
"said, and so did Judge Brew r er and the Court of Appeals "
"for the Seventh Circuit, that it was necessary to show that "
money was actually paid to some member of the Wisconsin 
legislature and that was not shown. 

Justice Harlan in a formal written opinion agreed with 
his brethren in their conclusion but dissented from their 
"method of reaching that conclusion. ""Sure,"" he said, "
some of that money had reached the members of the Wis 
"consin legislature, but because it was a legislative act, that "
"act, no matter how r corruptly brought about, was binding "
on the courts. The utter variance between Justice Harlan 
and his brethren as to the most important fact in the case 



"is ""EQUITY A ROGUISH THING: ? 549 "

"not only disgusted some of his brethren, but impeached the "
"conclusions he and his brethren had reached, and justified "
Walter Q. Gresham in quoting to Justice Harlan the couplet : 

"Those who have been in court declare, "
"An honest lawyer is very rare, "
In some the meanest culprit there 
Sits upon the bench. 

"This Angle case, although there was no formal break, "
destroyed some of the cordiality that I have described as 
existing between the Circuit Justice and the Circuit Judge. 
Here I am simply recording facts. Some people say judges 
"should have no feelings, and yet the chancery reports are "
full of expressions and imprecations to which the outraged 
consciences of the chancellors or equity judges have given 
voice and acted accordingly.

"opinion in the Wabash case, read December 6, "
"1886, was far-reaching in its effect. 1 It helped pass "
"the Interstate Commerce Law of 1887, putting under the "
"ban pools, rebates, and discriminations against localities. It "
"was ratified in .the Act of March 2, 1887, limiting the juris "
diction of the United States courts in that it provided that 
a receiver appointed by a Federal court should manage and 
operate such property according to the requirements of the 
valid laws of the State in which such property should be 
"situated."" And also that such a receiver may be sued in "
the State courts. 

"Prepared without any thought of attracting attention, "
and with less care than any opinion Walter Q. Gresham 
"ever wrote, the Wabash opinion was more of an executive "
than a judicial act and the direct result of what had pre 
ceded mature judicial reflection and action. Cutting to 
"the bone and ringing with conviction, only a few of the "
"reasons are given that made the act necessary, namely: "
"the removal of the receivers, John Humphreys and Thomas "
"E. Tutt, appointed by Circuit Judge David J. Brewer of "
"the Eighth Circuit, because they had been paying rebates; "
the appointment in their stead of ex-Judge Thomas Cooley 
"to operate that part of the railroad in Illinois, Indiana, and "
"Ohio, and the protection of the minority of certain of the "

underlying bondholders against the attempt of Jay Gould 
and his associates to force them into a reorganization they 
did not wish to enter because it primarily involved a re 
duction of the rates of their interest. There was no reason 
for the non-payment of the interest on the underlying bonds 
other than to subserve the purposes of Jay Gould as a rail 
road wrecker. 

Even before Walter Q. Gresham encountered Jay Gould s 
"reorganization or wrecking schemes, he had, in the most "
"carefully prepared opinions he ever wrote, aided by thorough "
"and exhaustive arguments, by men among the most emi "
"nent of the American bar, reached the conclusion that even "
"a single bondholder should be protected in a court of equity, "
"and that, too, against all the other bondholders and the rail "
road corporation that issued the bonds. This was on April 
"6, 1 886. The case was that of the Farmers Loan &amp; Trust Com "
pany vs. The Chicago &amp; Atlantic Railroad Company (27 Fed. 
Rep. 146). The counsel on one side were Benjamin H. Bris- 
"tow, H. B. Turner, and Joseph E. MacDonald; on the other, "
"Ashabel Green, Joseph H. Choate, 1 J. J. McCook, Charles I. "
"Atterbury, Charles W. Fairbanks, and Edward Daniels. "

"June 20, 1886, the Indiana, Bloomington &amp; Western "
"Railroad Company, owning and operating a line of railroad "
"from Peoria to Springfield, Ohio, with leased lines from "
"Springfield to Columbus, and Springfield to Sandusky, Ohio, "
became insolvent because of the construction the Supreme 
Court of Ohio put on the lease under which the Columbus 
and Sandusky line was operated. On behalf of the In 
"diana, Bloomington &amp; Western Railroad Company, Charles "
"W. Fairbanks, in a bill in which it was the plaintiff, copied "
after the bill General Wagner Swayne had filed in the 
"Wabash case, applied for a receiver. At Indianapolis on "
"June 6, 1886, the Circuit Judge said: ""No, we cannot ap "
point a receiver for an insolvent corporation at its instance 
"and against its creditors."" So a bill was filed by a creditor "
and the receiver was appointed. 

!See page 812. 



552 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

The Wabash receivership was and is unique in that 
Circuit Judge David J. Brewer had appointed the receivers 
"at the instance of the company itself, and after District "
Judge Treat at St. Louis had declined to act. Instead of 
the trustees for the bondholders or the creditors of the 
"company proceeding against the company, it had pro "
"ceeded against its creditors. At this time, May 28, 1884, "
"Jay Gould was, as he had long been, its dominant force, "
"often its president. Built from Toledo, Ohio, to Quincy "
"and Hannibal on the Mississippi, to take up the traffic of "
"the Wabash and Erie Canal from Toledo, Ohio, to the In "
diana and Illinois line and that originating in the heart of 
"Illinois, it possessed from the start immense earning power. "
"Honestly constructed and managed, there was no better "
railroad property in the United States. Many times had 
"it been wrecked and reorganized by Gould, Sage, and "
"Humphreys, but each time it had emerged from a fore "
closure or a receivership with a greater load of indebted 
ness. In 1869 the line from Decatur to St. Louis had 
"been acquired, and in 1871 the Chicago division was built. "
In 1880 there was a consolidation with a corporation own 
ing a line from St. Louis to Kansas City and Omaha under 
"the corporate name of the Wabash, St. Louis &amp; Pacific "
"Railway Company, with headquarters at St. Louis. "

"To the court at St. Louis, said the receivers, and in "
"this they were sustained by Judge Brewer, ""must all parties "
repair having business with or claims against the Wabash 
"property."" The other Federal judges through whose juris "
diction the road ran were simply to enter the decrees of 
the St. Louis court. 

"March n, 1885, District Judge Woods at Indianapolis "
"in a letter to Circuit Judge Gresham at Chicago, said: "

"At the instance of the receiver of the Wabash, after looking "
into the records of the court as to what had been done during 
"the strike of 1877, I instructed the United States marshal to in "
form the strikers at Fort Wayne what action had been taken in 



THE WABASH CASE 553 

"that year, and as I have heard nothing more, I suppose it has "
had the desired effect. 

"Now to the point. The trouble, as I understand, has arisen "
"from reductions in wages, and I have been thinking what the "
duty of the court may be in such cases. Should receivers be 
"allowed to make reductions without an order of court, or once "
"made, should the court inquire into the propriety or justness of "
the act^ I do not think that the losses incurred by railroads 
under pool arrangements or suicidal competition should be made 
good by cutting wages. Especially ought this not to be done 
upon the responsibility of the courts. 

"April 1 8, 1886, one of the Illinois patrons of the Wabash "
"road residing on the Chicago division, not far from Chicago, "
came before Judge Gresham at Chicago with a petition 
"which he asked leave to file, in which he said his stock had "
been killed on the Chicago division not far from Chicago 
"at a point where the road was not fenced, as the Illinois "
statute required. The prayer of the petition was that the 
receiver be ordered to pay him the value of the stock killed. 
The attorneys for the receiver promptly objected to the 
petition being filed and claimed that the United States 
Circuit Court for the Northern District of Illinois could 
"make no order in the premises, that only the court at St. "
Louis could do so. The attorney for the farmer was told 
he might hold his petition for a few days if he was not 
"in a hurry, otherwise he could go on to St. Louis. The "
attorney waited. 

"A short time before this Judge Gresham, on a bill filed "
"by the Illinois Central Railroad Company, had issued an "
"injunction against its switchmen, who were on a strike, "
and had been injuring its property and interfering with 
the management of its trains. 

"May 4, 1886, the attorneys for the receivers rushed into "
"court with a petition, and were in a great hurry to have "
orders issued to the United States marshal at Chicago to 
protect the receivers in their possession of the road at Chi 
"cago, Springfield and in the vicinity of Danville. Accord "
ing to a newspaper man the following colloquy occurred: 



554 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"In view of your position the other day, I may not have "
jurisdiction to enter the orders you ask. Had n t you better go 
"to the court at St. Louis?"" asked the judge. "

"But, said the lawyers, ""the court at St. Louis cannot ap "
"point marshals and issue orders to them in Illinois."" "

"And Jay Gould cannot run this court, come in here one day "
"and say we have n t jurisdiction, and the next day demand that "
we enter his orders. If it becomes necessary to protect the 
"property, we will do so, but in the meantime it may become "
necessary to remove Tutt and Humphreys and appoint some 
"honest citizen of Illinois in their places."" "

The records of the court disclose the following telegram 
"addressed May 4, 1886, to Humphreys and Tutt, the re "
"ceivers, by Judge Gresham: "

The Circuit Court of the United States is asked to appoint 
deputy marshals to protect you as receivers in the possession and 
management of the Wabash property here and elsewhere in this 
"district. If the emergency calls for such action, one of you should "
"be here. The request comes from Colonel Howe, one of your "
subordinates. 

To this telegram the receivers replied next day by letter : 

"We are in receipt of your telegram of yesterday, . . . for which "
"we are greatly obliged, and to which we have just replied thus: "

"We are obliged for your dispatch of yesterday, received last "
"night. We, the receivers, have never denied your jurisdiction over "
the property which we hold in trust for all the bonds and stock 
holders and other parties interested in the Wabash property. Col 
"onel Blodgett, our legal representative, will leave here to-night with "
"a petition to Your Honor asking protection. In the meanwhile, "
will you please afford such protection as you may deem advisable. 

We are greatly surprised to see in the papers of Thursday 
that you refused protection to the property in our charge as 
"receivers for all the parties interested in the Wabash Railroad, "
upon the supposition that we had denied your jurisdiction here 
"tofore, and we are pleased to have the opportunity of saying to "
Your Honor that no such action was ever taken by the receivers 
or any one representing them. 



THE WABASH CASE 555 

We have always appreciated the protection afforded us by 
"the United States Court, and but for the protection and a firm "
determination by the judges to uphold and sustain the majesty 
"of law and order, the great trust that we represent would have "
"been partially destroyed, to say the least, by lawless men long ago. "

"The Central Trust Company of New York did, we under "
"stand, offer the objection that Your Honor had no jurisdiction "
"over the Wabash property, but of this we knew nothing until "
"the past week."" "

"Before this letter was received, on the morning of the "
"6th, Colonel Blodgett, accompanied by Thomas E. Tutt, "
walked into the chambers of the Judge of the Circuit Court 
"at Chicago. And the evening of that day, before Mr. Tutt "
"started back to St. Louis, he sent to the Circuit Judge the "
following letter: 

I have this day visited the yards and freight business of the 
"Wabash Railway in Chicago, and find that considerable freight "
is being received and delivered. I am also informed by Mr. 
"Wade, our superintendent of transportation, and Mr. Talmadge, "
"our general manager, that the condition of affairs has been steadily "
"improving since yesterday morning, and it is their opinion that "
with deputy sheriffs and police now on duty in the vicinity of the 
"property they will, for the present at least, be able to continue "
"business, and in view of these facts, I think it unnecessary for "
the court to take any immediate action upon our petition filed 
"in your court yesterday, requesting the appointment of deputy "
marshals. 

"Meanwhile, soon after Tutt and Humphreys were ap "
"pointed receivers, Jay Gould caused foreclosure proceed "
ings to be begun against it at St. Louis under the general 
or blanket mortgage covering the main line from Toledo 
to Omaha via St. Louis with all its branches. This mort 
"gage secured an issue of $50,000,000. It was typical of "
Gould s system of financing. It was never claimed that 
much of the proceeds of that issue of bonds went into 
the improvement and betterment of the Wabash Railroad. 
This mortgage had gone to a decree of foreclosure before 



556 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN G RE SHAM 

"Judge Brewer at St. Louis. At a sale under it, April 26, "
"1886, the Jay Gould, Sidney Dillon, Russell Sage, and "
Solon Humphreys syndicate purchased the entire railroad 
"of the Wabash Company, with all its branches both east "
"and west of the river, and proceeded to whip into their "
reorganization which involved a reduction of interest 
from 7 to 5 per cent certain of the bondholders on the 
"Chicago division, 250 miles long, under the mortgage of "
"February i, 1867, covering the main line in Ohio, Indiana, "
"and Illinois from Toledo to Quincy, and a mortgage dated "
"May 17, 1879. Between these last two and the mortgage "
"($50,000,000) that Gould was foreclosing in Judge Brewer s "
court were ten other separate mortgages each securing a 
separate series of bonds. 

"These thirteen mortgages secured an aggregate of $27,- "
"000,000 of bonds. Above them, or subordinate to them "
"as liens, was Gould s $50,000,000 mortgage. All of this "
"$27,000,000 had been whipped into the fold but about "
"$4,000,000 which was held by one Bears and his associates, "
"$1,800,000 on the Chicago Division, and the rest, $2,200,000, "
"on the main line, held by one Atkins and his associates. "
Bears and Atkins were threatened with all kinds of litiga 
"tion, and orders were entered at St. Louis by Judge Brewer "
"September 6 and 7, 1886, that left it to the discretion of "
"the receivers, Tutt and Humphreys, as to what underlying "
"bondholders should receive interest on their bonds, pend "
ing the reorganization. Under these orders the Bears and 
Atkins bondholders w r ere denied interest. Orders had also 
been entered by Judge Brewer s court that put claims for 
labor and supplies incurred by the Missouri Pacific Com 
pany while it operated the Wabash Road for thirteen 
"months immediately preceding the receiverships, a charge "
"upon the Wabash Railroad, as a lien superior to the liens "
of the Wabash mortgages. 

"Bears and Atkins, by able counsel, Henry Crawford and "
"D. H. Chamber lin of South Carolina fame, had watched "



THE W A BASH CASE 557 

"the proceedings in the Chicago &amp; Atlantic and the Indiana, "
"Bloomington &amp; Western, and the proceedings in the Wabash "
case. These precedents made them bold to act. 

"Bears, on behalf of himself and his associate bondholders, "
filed in the Northern District of Illinois a bill to foreclose 
"the mortgage on the Chicago Division, while Atkins, by "
"another bill in the Southern District of Illinois, took sim "
ilar action under the two mortgages mentioned on the main 
line. In addition to asking for the foreclosure of the mort 
"gages, they moved the court to remove Humphreys and "
Tutt on the ground that they were not fit persons to act as 
"receivers, and to appoint some capable, trustworthy person "
in their stead. 

Much testimony was taken in support of the motion to 
remove Tutt and Humphreys. They were put on the wit 
ness stand and made to admit they were without the quali 
fications necessary to manage a railroad. General Swayne 
also became a witness to explain how some of the orders at 
"St. Louis were procured. Those who heard it, said, at the "
"final hearing on the motion to remove the receivers, that "
Henry Crawford s argument was one of the best ever heard 
in a courtroom. 

"The decision said it was unusual and novel, at the in "
"stance of an insolvent railroad corporation, without notice "
"to appoint as a receiver against its creditors, one of its "
stockholders who had been unsuccessful in its management. 
It denied that the court at St. Louis had paramount juris 
"diction over the property in Illinois, asserted that it was the "
duty of a court of equity to protect the rights of minority 
"bondholders, and in commenting on the assertion of the "
attorneys that it was right for the reorganization committee 
to discriminate against the non-assenting bondholders in 
"paying interest, the following language was used : "

The boldness of this scheme to aid the purchasers by denying 
"equal rights to all bondholders secured by the same mortgage, "
is equaled only by its injustice. The right is asserted by the 



558 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"purchasers of the property, in a court of equity, to take the earn "
ings of a road covered by a mortgage and pay part of the coupons 
"secured by that mortgage, to the exclusion of coupons secured "
by the same mortgages and falling due at the same time. Doubt 
less the counsel who obtained the orders of September 21 was 
not as frank in avowing to the court at St. Louis the purposes 
"of the purchasers as he was here, and still is in defending his "
interpretation of them. 

Criticism was made of the orders of the court at St. 
Louis in directing that the earnings of the Wabash Company 
be applied to the payment of the indebtedness incurred by 
the Missouri Pacific Company while operating the Wabash 
"Railroad, and in issuing receivers certificates to pay that "
indebtedness. 

"Gould, Sage, Dillon, and Humphreys were indorsers of "
"$2, coo, ooo of the promissory notes of the Wabash Company "
at the time the receivers were appointed. Two days later 
the court at St. Louis authorized the issuing of receivers 
certificates to pay that indebtedness. That was one of the 
"objects in view when Gould, Humphreys, Dillon, and Sage, "
as a majority of the meeting of the Executive Committee 
"of the Wabash Company, decided on the 2ist of May, "
"1884, that they would put the Wabash Railroad Company "
into the hands of a receiver. Receivers were authorized to 
pay rebates which the Missouri Pacific Company had agreed 
to pay prior to the appointment of the receiver. They paid 
"such rebate claims to the extent of $360,000 and $3,200,000 "
on account of labor and supply claims incurred by the 
Missouri Pacific Company while in the possession of the 
"Wabash property. It also was shown that Gould, Hum "
"phreys, Dillon, Sage, Hopkins, and Charles Ridgeley were "
"all directors of the Ellsworth Coal Company, owning a mine "
"near the Wabash Railroad in Sangamon County, Illinois; "
that they paid rebates on coal shipped prior to the receiver 
"ship, and that on coal shipped since the appointment of the "
"receiver and up to September i, 1886, they had paid rebates "



THE W A B A S H CASE 5 5 g 

"amounting to $6^,305^5, equal to the entire eapital of the "
"eoal company, and besides, the receivers were hauling coal "
for this company to Chicago at less than current rates; that 
receiver Humphreys himself had said in a statement filed 
with the court that the rates were so low that they had 
caused the receivership. The opinion proceeds: 

Men with a proper appreciation of their rights and the 
rights of others trustworthy men are not apt to be found in 
"such inconsistent relation. Gould, Humphreys, Dillon, Sage, "
"Hopkins, and Ridgeley are men of stern integrity if their interests "
in the coal company would not improperly influence their action 
as directors of the Wabash Company. It is going very far 
farther than this court is willing to go to enforce a secret con 
"tract for the rebate of freight paid to a railroad company, and to "
"the extent of his interest in the coal company, Humphreys allowed "
a rebate to himself. 

So Humphreys and Tutt were removed and Thomas 
Cooley was appointed receiver of the Wabash lines in Illinois. 
He managed the property so successfully that Mr. Cleve 
land made him chairman of the Interstate Commerce Com 
mission when it was organized. 

General John McNulta succeeded Judge Cooley as re 
"ceiver of the Wabash. Much rehabilitation work \vas done, "
which Jay Gould himself approved; although when the 
"language of the court, and other expressions, went broad "
cast over the country at the time the decision was made 
"public, Gould was bitter in his denunciation of the judge - "
said he was a candidate for the Presidency. 

"Judge John Schofield, of the Illinois vSupreme Court, "
"summed up Gresham as follows : ""I look upon Gresham "
as combining in himself two great qualities --qualities rarely 
found together he possesses executive ability and a judi 
"cial mind, and to an unusual degree. Many of our great "
"men have possessed one or the other of these qualities, but "
few have possessed both. In Andrew Jackson we had a 
sample of the men who have great executive ability but 
30

small reasoning faculties. Daniel Webster was one of the 
"other class."" "

The opinion was given the widest publicity. Of it the 
"editor of the American Law Review, S. D. Thompson, the au "
"thor of that standard work, ""Thompson on Corporations,"" "
"wrote January 14, 1887, ""We will do what we never have "
"done before with any decision, print it in full."" From his "
"law office in New York Robert G. Ingersoll wrote, ""You "
never did a better thing than the action you took in the 
"Wabash case. , . . Confidence in the judiciary of the "
country will go far towards doing away with the spirit of 
riot and disorder. If the people really feel that the bench 
"will stand by the right, there is no danger; when it is known "
that no man can be rich enough or popular enough to 
"pervert judgment the people will be satisfied."" Judge Dyer "
"wrote: ""Your decision in the Wabash case is making a "
great stir. You are being abused by the pirates and com 
mended by all good people. . . . I am glad I belong in 
"the Seventh Circuit which once had Judge Drummond."" "

Although ratified within three months by the passage 
"of the Interstate Commerce Act, putting rebates, prefer "
"ences, and discriminations under the ban of the statute "
"law, and by the two subsequent acts of Congress, Judge "
Gresham s opinion in the Wabash case was the cause of 
the rebuke the Supreme Court administered in 1890 in the 
appeals that went to the Supreme Court in the Narrow 
Gauge case. 1

#NAME?
ELAINE WITHDRAWS AS CANDIDATE GRESHAM BOOM- 

JUDGE GRESHAM REFUSES TO MAKE TERMS WITH PLATT 
AND QUAY PLATT S POWER IN THE CONVENTION. 

A FTER James G. Elaine s defeat as the Republican 
"^""^ candidate for President in 1884 it was thought that "
he would not again ask for the Presidency. Grover Cleve 
"land had defeated him by a narrow margin, especially in "
"New York, where the Democrats had only 1,100 more "
"votes than the Republicans, with the Greenback, Prohi "
"bition, and Labor parties casting an unusually large vote "
for their respective candidates. But Oregon unexpectedly 
"went Republican in 1886, and again Mr. Blaine was put "
forward. In Indiana and Connecticut the Republicans 
"prevailed over the Democrat, Prohibitionist, and Labor "
parties by scant pluralities. Conceding that Mr. Blaine 
"might again lose New York with its large electoral vote, his "
"many friends, who were ardent in their devotion to him, "
"said that with Oregon, Indiana, and Connecticut doubtful "
"States, and with the sure Republican States, he would not "
again need New York. At this time Mr. Blaine had been 
abroad for over a year. In the West the Chicago Tribune 
"was the leading Republican paper, and it took the lead in "
again pressing Mr. Blaine on his party and the country. 

"Meanwhile Walter Q. Gresham s prediction of 1884, "
that the surplus for the fiscal years 1885-1886 and 1886- 
"1887 would increase, had been verified. Money beyond "

562 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN G RE SHAM 

the needs of the government was piling up in the Treasury. 
"The talk of the hour was, the best way to reduce this sur "
"plus. To the Congress that met December 4, 1887, Grover "
Cleveland sent his famous message in favor of the reduction 
of the tariff. 

"Departing from the custom in an annual message, Mr. "
Cleveland said he would call the attention of Congress to 
"a single subject, the dangers of the increasing surplus in "
"the Treasury and the means of reducing it, namely, by "
"reducing the duties on imports. Short, the message was "
read by everybody. The surplus for the three years end 
"ing June 30, 1887, after meeting. all the requirements of "
"the government, interest on the war debt, and the pro "
"visions of the sinking fund, was $122,833,130.22. For "
"the five months ending December i, 1887, said President "
"Cleveland, the excess was $55,258,701.11. Manifestly he "
had been studying President Arthur and Secretary of the 
Treasury Folger s recommendations as detailed in a pre 
vious chapter. 1 

The surplus had in part been used in retiring the three 
per cent bonds which were payable at the option of the 
"government. But on the 3oth of June, 1887, all of these "
"had been redeemed, and since then and prior to December "
"i of that year, $27,684,283.55 had been expended in the "
"purchase of government bonds not yet due, bearing four "
"and four and one-half per cent interest, the premium paid "
averaging about twenty-four per cent for the former and 
four per cent for the latter. The surplus for the fiscal 
"year ending June 30, 1888, Mr. Cleveland estimated at "
"$113,000,000.00 "

"Clear it was, argued Mr. Cleveland, as President Arthur "
"had predicted, that the present revenue would create a "
surplus that when due in 1891 would liquidate the four 
"and one-half per cent bonds amounting to $250,000,000, "
"and before the four per cents amounting to $737,000,000 "
matured in 1907 the money would be in the Treasury to 

ISee page 498. 



EVENTS PRIOR TO 1888 CONVENTION 563 

redeem them. The danger was shown of the government 
"collecting more revenue than it needed, the iniquity of "
placing government money in the banks in order to get 
"it back in the hands of the people, and the necessity of "
entirely divorcing the government from private business. 
11 But the tax on tobacco and spiritous and malt liquors 
shou Id be ret a ined . 

"Naturally Mr. Cleveland formulated the phrases, ""It "
"is a condition which confronts us, not a theory."" That "
he was no free trader the following will suffice to show: 

It is not proposed entirely to relieve the country of this tax 
ation. It must be extensively continued as the source of the 
government income; and in a readjustment of our tariff the 
interests of American labor engaged in manufacture should be 
"carefully considered, as well as the preservation of our manu "
"facturers. It may be called protection, or by any other name, "
but relief from the hardships and dangers of our present tariff 
"laws should be devised, with special precaution against imperiling "
the existence of our manufacturing interests. But this existence 
"should not mean a condition which, without regard to the public "
"welfare or a national exigency, must always insure the realization "
of immense profits instead of moderately profitable returns. 

"To the ""infant industries"" of one hundred years growth "
there were sarcastic allusions. The combinations and the 
trusts which were formed to prevent the domestic com 
petition which it had been urged would follow a protec 
"tive tariff, were justly condemned and pointed to as ""proof "
"that some one is willing to accept lower prices, and that "
"such prices are remunerative."" "

Then Mr. Cleveland argued in favor of free raw mate 
"rials for the manufacturers, and urged taking the tariff "
"off wool. With great force, but without the address and "
"skill of Arthur and Folger, the President demanded a reduc "
"tion of the customs duties. Said he: ""Our present tariff "
"laws, the vicious, inequitable, and illogical source of unnec "
"essary taxation, ought to be at once revised and amended."" "



564 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"When passed these tariff laws were not vicious, inequitable, "
"illogical, and unnecessary. This sentence was used in "
"many quarters to revive the old war spirit. ""Exactly "
the expression of a man who hired a substitute during the 
"war and who went fishing on Decoration Day,"" said the "
"Tariff Barons, and promptly the soldier element took "
up the c/y. A deft advocate would not have so denounced 
the war tariff. 

Arthur and Folger had handled the subject in such a 
"way that the tariff barons, the combiners, the trust mag "
"nates, and even Mr. Elaine, for a time, assented to their "
conclusion reduce the tariff duties. 

It has since been claimed by many Democrats that it 
was the right message but at the wrong time. It should 
"have come earlier, in order to have given time to meet "
the falsehoods and misrepresentations of the new order of 
protectionists. The Democratic party at that time was 
disorganized to a large extent over the distribution of 
patronage. The message undoubtedly drew the attention 
of Cleveland s party and the country from the squabbles 
over the offices and centered the public mind on the then 
"one great question before the country, the revision of the "
tariff. 

"The day following the appearance of the message, Mr. "
Elaine in an interview at London answered Cleveland s 
arguments for a revision of the tariff. In this interview- 
Mr. Elaine denounced President Cleveland as a free trader 
"and, going beyond the Republican platform of 1884, advo "
cated higher protection than had ever before been advanced 
in this country. For the first time was it suggested that 
the tax on whiskey and tobacco be removed so that the 
manufacturers might have more protection. This inter 
view came by cable and went broadcast over the land. 
"Every newspaper published it on the front page, with head "
lines to attract attention. It was as universally read as 
had been the message the day before. 



EVENTS PRIOR TO 1888 CONVENTION 565 

Simultaneously with this famous interview there ap 
peared in the Chicago Tribune a leading editorial by Joseph 
Medill in which he took strong ground in support of Mr. 
Cleveland s message. The editorial was written and Mr. 
Medill had gone home before Mr. Elaine s interview was 
put on the wires. 

Joseph Medill was then sixty-seven years of age. He 
was the last of the great editors who had contributed so 
much to the development and advancement of the principles 
of the Republican party. Born in Ohio and educated for 
"the law, he early turned to journalism, moved to Chicago "
"in the early fifties, and became associated with the Chicago "
"Tribune. In a knowledge of economics, finance, and the "
"tariff, the principles and history of free government, and "
"in what is called force, he was the peer of any man the "
nation had produced. Versed in all the ways and acts of 
"the public man, he was a statesman in all save that his "
first allegiance was due to the great and prosperous news 
paper property he had built up. At times this made him 
timid. He was one of the leaders in the movement to 
nominate Mr. Lincoln. In 1886 I had heard him tell the 
"same story I had heard from Judge Davis s lips, how in "
"1860, in order to secure Mr. Lincoln s nomination, they "
"had promised all the cabinet and other executive offices, "
"and how Mr. Lincoln carried out all their agreements, "
although protesting that they had left nothing for him. 
"But one phase of the story was distinctly Joseph Medill, "
and as it has never been in print I will tell it here: 

After the convention adjourned on the second day before a 
"ballot, while Thurlow Weed was leading a street parade for "
"Seward, we went to the Pennsylvania delegation and made a "
"deal whereby Simon Cameron, Pennsylvania s choice, would "
"be withdrawn after a complimentary ballot, the vote of Penn "
"sylvania cast for Mr. Lincoln, and in the event of Mr. "
Lincoln s election Simon Cameron would be made Secretary 
"of War. The next day, when the convention met, my anxiety "



566 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"was great, for Pennsylvania was the trump card in the deck. It "
became intense after the first ballot when the chairman of the 
Pennsylvania delegation asked that Pennsylvania might retire 
for a consultation. By the time Pennsylvania was reached on the 
"second roll call her delegation had returned, and the chairman "
"announced in a beautiful speech that, having sought divine guid "
"ance, Mr. Cameron s name was withdrawn and Pennsylvania s "
vote was cast for Mr. Lincoln. And yet we had bought them 
the night before. 

"The sentence ""And yet we had bought them the night "
"before,"" made a profound impression on my husband. "
Row much it had to do with his subsequent career the 
following pages will disclose. 

"Airs. Medill was a charming, accomplished woman, and "
one of the ablest I ever knew. A few days after the joint 
appearance of Mr. Elaine s interview on the President s 
"message and Mr. Medill s editorial, Mrs. Medill told me "
that when they read Mr. Elaine s interview in the Tribune 
"together with Mr. Medill s editorial, ""Mr. Medill became "
very much concerned as to what would be the effect on the 
"circulation and the popularity of the Tribune, but after "
"thinking it over he determined to stand by his guns. ""And "
great was and is our surprise and gratification to find/ 
"she added, ""that the stand that Mr. Medill had taken is "
popular. The ground swell from the country and the 
"country press arc with us."" Walker Elaine and Emmons "
"Elaine, both of whom were then living in Chicago, and were "
representatives and emissaries for their father in the Elaine 
"movement, she said, ""were very much concerned at Mr. "
"Medill s attitude, and had endeavored to induce him to "
"modify his position on the tariff, but they were unable to "
"do so."" "

The Chicago Tribune had been the only newspaper in 
Chicago that had been supporting Elaine. The out-and- 
out Elaine boomers at once became very bitter toward 
"Joseph Medill, and denounced him as a free trader of "



EVENTS PRIOR TO 1SSS CONVENTION 567 

"the Grover Cleveland sehool. He retorted in kind. ""The "
"mill bosses,"" ""the trust leaders,"" the railroad wreckers, "
"and the Jay Goulds were scored, while much was said in "
"leading editorials about the messages of President Arthur, "
"Secretary Folger, the Republican platform of 1884, and the "
"protectionism of Henry Clay, which was not that of war "
taxes in time of peace. This state of affairs could not con 
tinue indefinitely. 

"On February 12, 1888, B. F. Jones of Pittsburgh and "
"of the iron interests, chairman of the Republican National "
"Committee, gave out a letter he had received from Mr. "
"Blaine. This letter was written from Florence, Italy, un "
"der date of January 25, 1888, and in it Mr. Blaine stated "
he would not again be a candidate for the Presidency. 
"The retirement of Mr. Blaine, said the Tribune, left only "
"one avowed candidate, the Honorable John Sherman. "
"But the great mass of the Blaine leaders, and the men who "
"were receiving undue benefits from the war tariffs, refused "
to accept Mr. Elaine s letter as final. Nor did the Tribune 
make a formal renunciation of Mr. Blaine. 

"In a way, some time before this time, Mr. Gresham "
"had developed what is called a ""potential Presidential "
"boom."" Most of the old Arthur followers had turned to "
"him. Church Howe, one of the Arthur delegates from "
"Nebraska in 1884, made public the statement that Arthur "
"had told him in 1884 that if he, Arthur, could not get the "
"nomination, he wanted Gresham to have it. "

Mr. Elaine s withdrawal brought forth a number of 
candidates. General Harrison was one of these. He had 
"been a Blaine man, and so long as Mr. Elaine was in the "
"attitude of a candidate, General Harrison would not antag "
onize him. Senator John Sherman of Ohio said he had 
been waiting for Elaine s letter of declination which he 
"knew would come, and at once he was an active candi "
"date. Senator Allison of Iowa, William Walter Phelps of "
"New Jersey, Governor Russell A. Alger of Michigan and "



568 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"of the Diamond Match Company, and Chauncey M. "
"Depew of New York, the president of the New York Cen "
"tral Railroad, were put forward, the last two as business "
men s candidates. The old Grant guard had forgiven 
Walter Q. Gresham his support of Bristow and were almost 
"kindly disposed, while the independents and the indepen "
dent press were too cordial in his praise to suit many of the 
"Elaine men and the ""machine"" leaders. It was the inde "
"pendent press and the independents, the ""Mugwumps,"" "
who had defeated Mr. Elaine. 

Many favorable notices of Judge Gresham had ap 
peared in the Chicago Tribune before President Cleveland s 
"message. Suddenly, February 22, 1888, it changed from "
"Elaine to Gresham. The movement took like wildfire, if the "
"press notices are any criterion. The Chicago Inter Ocean, "
"the old Grant paper, joined in. To an objection of one of "
the Tribune s oldest Elaine readers that it was going to the 
support of a man who had not only supported General 
"Grant for a third term, but who also had the indorsement "
"of the Inter Ocean, the Tribune said its opposition to a third "
term did not extend to proscribing those who had favored 
"General Grant for a third term, and as to the Inter Ocean, "
it could fight it on some other issue than Gresham.. 

"Anticipating Mr. Elaine s withdrawal, General Hani- "
"son s friends, who controlled the machine in Indiana, "
went actively to work to secure the delegates from that 
State to the convention which the Republican National 
"Committee had, late in December, called to meet in Chi "
"cago June 1 8, 1888. James N. Huston of Connersville was "
reflected chairman of the Indiana State Central Committee 
and one of the delegates-at-large from the State to the 
"National convention; Colonel Richard W. Thompson, then "
"almost in his dotage, Clement Studebaker, the manu "
"facturer, of South Bend, and one of the Grant 306 of 1880, "
"and ex-Governor Albert G. Porter of Indiana, made up the "
other three delegates-at-large from Indiana. 



EVENTS PRIOR TO 1888 CONVENTION 569 

Governor Porter was then in the full vigor of life. He 
"was opposed to General Harrison s nomination, although "
they had been law partners years before. Porter was a 
"dark horse, for Porter first, Gresham second, and almost "
anybody rather than Harrison. The Harrison leaders knew 
this and wished to prevent Governor Porter from going 
"as a delegate to the convention ""to pose as a Garfield "
"candidate,"" but they could not do so. All that could be "
done was to instruct him to vote for General Harrison s 
nomination with other delegates-at-large and the delegates 
elected in all the districts except one. Some of Porter s 
friends posed as Gresham men; others as Harrison men. 
Those who were in the inner circle secretly took to Chicago 
a carload of Porter lithographs ready to placard the town 
in the event that Porter should be nominated. 

"Many of the district delegates were Gresham men, and "
"all except two or three, possibly only one, Elijah W. Halford, "
"editor of the Indianapolis Journal, were willing to vote for "
"Gresham. Mr. Halford and John C. New, the owner of "
"the Indianapolis Journal, and the member of the Repub "
"lican National Committee from Indiana, were personally "
and bitterly opposed to Judge Gresham. Before the 
"delegates were elected, Mr. New in public interviews said "
"Gresham was a free trader, that he had voted for Tilden in "
"1876, and had refused to vote for Elaine in 1884. James "
Gordon Bennett by telegram tendered the columns of the 
New York Herald in answer to Mr. New. Mr. Gresham 
promptly assured Mr. Bennett that w r hile he would make 
"no public statement, he was not a candidate and would "
"not be in the sense the term is used, but the courteous "
"offer required an answer and he would say, Mr. New s "
statements were untrue. Then the Chicago Tribune stated 
on its first page that Mr. New s hostility to Mr. Gresham 
dated from the time Judge Gresham instructed the Federal 
"grand jury, regardless of orders from Washington to desist, "
to investigate the failure of the First National Bank of 



570 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN ORE SHAM 

"Indianapolis, of which Mr. New had been president. The "
instructions to that grand jury have already been discussed. 

"The Chicago Tribune s attacks, supplemented by the work "
"of Charles W. Fairbanks, who had taken charge of the "
"Gresham boom in Indiana, for a time silenced New s and "
Halford s mendacious statements. Their bitterness was in 
"creased by the fight that three young lawyers, Joseph B. "
"Kealing, Martin M. Hugg, and A. W. Wishard made against "
Mr. Halford s election as a delegate to the National con 
"vention from the Indianapolis District. Some time before, "
the Journal had locked out its union printers. The young 
"lawyers said it would never do to elect the editor of ""a rat "
"shop"" to represent the party of human freedom in a National "
convention. Mr. Halford barely squeezed through after an 
awful rumpus had been stirred up which was not finally 
"settled, and then only partially, until late in the campaign "
"when General Harrison, as the candidate of his party, and "
the Republican National Committee forced Mr. New to 
unionize his shop. 

"John W. Foster, in December, 1884, had resigned his "
place as Minister to Spain and resumed his position as 
counsel for the Mexican Legation in Washington. Other 
"business came to him of this kind, such as counsel f.or the "
Chinese Legation and for the life insurance companies in 
"their international relations, so he remained in Washington "
"but retained his residence at Evansville, Indiana. He "
wrote Gresham editorials for the Evansville Journal and 
helped Charles W. Fairbanks manage the Gresham boom. 
"Adept in the arts and ways of the diplomat, deprecating "
"the strife and contention between Gresham and Harrison, "
he caused an account of General Harrison s opposition to 
the exclusion of the Chinese from this country to be pub 
lished in the New York Herald. It was copied all over 
"the country and seemed, some of the practical men said, "
"to remove General Harrison from the list, for one of "
the strongest planks in Mr. Blaine s platform was his 



EVENTS PRIOR TO 1 s s s CONVENTION 571 

opposition to Chinese immigration. Whence came this 
bomb the Harrison people never knew. 

"Mr. Fairbanks stayed until the last roll call, but* Mr. "
"Foster, being a diplomat, before the convention met asked "
for his release and got it. 

"Stephen B. Elkins of the Confederate ""Bushwhackers"" "
"of Missouri, then of New Mexico and of New York and not "
"long before of West Virginia, one of the original Blaine "
"men, after the exposure of General Harrison s pro-Chinese "
record renewed his insistence that Blaine should be nomi 
"nated. ""But if it is not Blaine, it will be the field against "
"Gresham,"" Mr. Elkins said. "

Since Gresham was the antithesis of Blaine on the 
method of reducing the surplus and almost all other details 
"of the administration of public affairs, there was nothing "
else for his supporters to do but to antagonize the Blaine 
propaganda. 

Certain it is that had Judge Gresham been nominated 
"and elected President in 1888, he was not under even an "
implied promise to make Mr. Blaine what the latter said 
was the real ambition of his life Secretary of State. 

"May 1 6, 1888, Colonel R. G. Ingersoll wrote Judge "
Gresham from his residence in New York: 

I was in Washington yesterday. I had a long conversation 
"with Boutcllc [a member of Congress from Maine], Elaine s right- "
"hand man, and I told him that Blaine could not be elected; that "
"his friends would be cool and his enemies hot, and if he was "
"nominated, after his letter, he would be the worst beaten candi "
date that ever ran. I am satisfied that he thinks so too. The 
friends of Blaine are going to make all they can out of the corpse* 
Blaine will do the best he can with the winner. You know 
him perfectly and remember what he wanted to do with you when 
you were in Arthur s cabinet. I want you to win now. 1 

When Colonel Ingersoll got to Chicago and the situation 
"was laid before him, he supported Judge Gresham in the "
latter s determination not to make that or any other pledge. 

1 See page 495- 



572 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

Mr. Gresham told the Colonel that he could have the 
nomination if he would agree to make Platt Secretary of 
"the Treasury, but he did not want to do so. ""Bob"" said, "
Don t do it. I will go down with you. 

It was assumed as to all the other gentlemen who were 
"voted for in the 88 Convention, avowed as to some, that "
in the event of election Mr. Elaine would be Secretary 
of State. Soon after he became a member of General 
"Harrison s cabinet in 1891, Mr. Elkins admitted that after "
"the split between ""Old Joe"" Medill and Mr. Elaine on the "
"tariff, at a conference of Elaine men in December, 1887, in "
"New York, one of them produced a letter from General "
Harrison in which he said if he were nominated and elected 
President he would make Mr. Elaine Secretary of State. 
"This letter, Whitelaw Reid and Mr. Elkins, through Gail "
"Hamilton, Mrs. Elaine s sister, sent to Mrs. Elaine. We "
make this statement not by way of criticism of General 
Harrison. For twelve years he had supported Mr. Elaine 
"for the Presidency; why, then, should he hesitate to say he- "
"would make Elaine Secretary of State in the event that he, "
"General Hamson, should become President? "

"The ""Mugwump"" or independent opposition to Mr. "
"Elaine is best illustrated by what John H. Holliday, the "
Mugwump or independent editor of the Indianapolis 
"News, said in his paper on March 5, i88g, on the cabinet "
as sent to the Senate the day before: 

Had it been a plain and understood fact any time before the 
"election that Mr. Blaine would be the Secretary of State, General "
Harrison would have failed to carry Indiana and New York 
and would have been defeated. In surrendering to hirr^ General 
"Harrison has surrendered to the party s worst elements, and "
done that which there was the strongest pre-election faith among 
other elements he would not do. 

"And w r hen it came to pledges, there was one man more "
powerful than James G. Blaine in the 1888 Convention 
ex-Senator Thomas C. Platt of New York. 



EVENTS PRIOR TO 1888 CONVENTION 573 

So hard did the Chicago Tribune continue to controvert 
"the proposition for free whiskey and tobacco, which Chaun- "
cey Depew had defended at the February 226. celebration 
"before the Chicago Union League Club, and so hard did it "
"press the Elaine people, ""the trusts ""and ""mill bosses,"" "
that some of the latter made overtures to Judge Gresham 
to disavow Joseph Medill and the Tribune. His reply was 
that he would never stand for a higher tariff than that of 
"1884, would never depart from his sub-treasury speech of "
"1884, and that he would make no such request of Mr. Medill. "
"To Mr. Medill he said, ""Throw the shot into them."" "

Here we may be permitted to anticipate and to remark 
that a man who could drive the leader of his party from the 
"lists should not have hesitated ""to walk out when the trusts "
"and mill bosses"" seized his pen and in convention assembled "
"wrote his platform, especially as his new candidate would "
lead the bolt. 

Frank Hatton as he was universally called who 
"succeeded my husband as Postmaster-General, soon after "
the close of the Arthur administration came to Chicago as 
editor of the Evening Mail. Mr. Hatton had been the first 
assistant postmaster-general while my husband was at the 
"head of the department. Never a fair critic of Mr. Elaine, "
"and one of the original Grant men, Frank Hatton was very "
"bright, and aggressive as a terrier. His autobiography was "
"typical of the man. ""He had graduated from a printer s "
devil in a small town in Ohio into the army when a mere 
"boy, came back with a commission, started to edit the "
"weekly paper at Mount Pleasant, Iowa, married Sally "
"Snyder, and then with ""Bob"" Burdett made the Burlington- "
"Hawkeye famous."" Mrs. Hatton was a most agreeable "
"woman. She, her husband, and their young son, Dick, "
were our neighbors and friends on the North Side in Chi 
"cago, in 1885-1886-1887. Of course the Mail was a bright "
"paper. It ran the Wabash decision in full, and in its "
editorials made great sport of Jay Gould and of his friend 



574 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN ORE SHAM 

Judge Gresham. After a time Mr. Hatton sold out his 
interest in the Mail and moved to Xe\v York. In the 
Spring of 1888 he turned up at Chicago as the forerunner 
and manager of the movement to nominate John Sherman. 
This in no wise interfered with our cordial relations. On 
"the contrary, it brought us much information of the move "
ment behind the scenes. In the practical politics of a 
National convention Frank Hatton was an adept. Mr. 
Hatton said: 

"There are more men, more newspapers, and more newspaper "
"men in the United States for Gresham than ever were for Elaine, "
but with Old Joe Medill hammering away at Elaine and the new 
"tariff propaganda, the ""dyed in the wool"" Elaine men will never "
"permit Gresham to be nominated, so John Sherman must bo the "
man. 

Most of the Southern delegates were captured by 
Senator John Sherman. The expenses of electing them 
and of their transportation were borne by Mr. Sherman. 
But no sooner had they reached Chicago than General 
"Alger s agents were after them, and before the preliminary "
"organization was completed, Frank Hatton said, ""Alger "
"has bought up all our niggers."" "

They were corralled in rooms in the Sherman- House 
and carefully guarded. Even the hall leading to these 
"rooms was rented by the Alger people, and the man sta "
tioned at its entrance allowed no one to enter except those 
duly authenticated. Possibly had General Alger not en 
"tered the lists, Sherman, as he professed to believe,, would "
"have been nominated. However this may be, the opera "
tions of the essentially business men s candidate in the 88 
Convention were a potent factor in the enactment of John 
Sherman s anti-trust act of 1890. 

Erastus Brainerd of the Daily Xcus of Philadelphia was 
one of the newspaper men Mr. Hatton had in mind when 
he spoke of the great number of newspaper men turning 
to Gresham. We make mention of Mr. Brainerd because 

!See page 635. 



EVENTS PRIOR TO 1888 CONVENTION 575 

"his principles were high, and his environment peculiar as "
illustrating the times. Without any personal acquaintance 
"with Walter Q. Gresham, Mr. Brainerd in the columns of "
his paper had taken up and pushed the Gresham boom 
with great vigor. He was fortunate in having some Gresham 
sentiment to start with. 

"From March 4, 1885, ex-Attorney-General B. H. Brew- "
ster had been urging Gresham s availability; also General 
"B. F. Hickenlooper and his brother, F. W. Hickenlooper. "
"Members of Congress, like General Harry Bingham, were "
"favorable. George W r . Childs said he was for Gresham, "
"and his paper, the Leader, was cordial in its commendation. "
"As elected by districts, some of the delegates from Phila "
"delphia, as interviewed by Mr. Brainerd s paper, declared "
themselves for Gresham. John Wanamaker stated in a 
"public interview that he had interviewed Gresham, and "
that Gresham was a good enough Protectionist for him. 
"Again Hamilton Disson, one of the Arthur delegates of "
"1884, was a delegate. "

Mr. Brainerd drew other newspaper men into the move 
ment. He wrote Judge Gresham many personal letters. 
"Not a politician, and with no taste for the ""trades"" that he "
"found to be a part of the system, he said men who were "
"delegates were coming to him for promises for offices ""I "
can not even tell them I am personally acquainted with 
"my candidate."" Mr. Gresham replied to this: ""Your "
letter demands a frank answer : I stand by my tariff utter 
"ances in my sub-treasury speech in New York in 1884."" "
"Then, as to ""trades"": ""As I am not standing before the "
"country as a candidate, I can not make an organization "
"or combination, without which a nomination is scarcely "
"to be expected. I do not expect to be nominated."" "

"In the preliminary stages Joseph Medill, Walter Q. "
"Gresham, and at least John Sherman, knew that the "
control of the Republican Convention of 1888 would be in 
"the hands of two men, ex-Senator Thomas C. Platt, the "



576 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"chairman of the New York delegation, and United States "
"Senator Matthew Stanley Quay, chairman of the Pennsyl "
vania delegation and slated for chairman of the Republican 
National Committee. 

"April 19, 1888, P. A. B. Widener, of the Widener-Elkins "
"Street Car Syndicate, came to Chicago as an agent of "
"Senator Quay and called on Joseph Medill. Mr. Widener, "
"so Mr. Medill wrote, had said that he, Widener, had but "
"a slight acquaintance with Judge Gresham, not enough to "
"call on him, but that if Judge Gresham expected to get "
the nomination he ought to have an organization and some 
one authorized to speak for him; that Senator Quay would 
"control the Pennsylvania delegation, that Quay, although "
"nominally for Senator John Sherman, was not committed "
to any one; that because of the want of an understanding 
the Pennsylvanians had fared badly with President Hayes 
and with Garfield ; that they had had an understanding with 
Mr. Lincoln s friends in 1860 which had been carried out 
"to the mutual advantage of both sides. ""Name some one "
"as your ipse dixit and send him to Senator Quay,"" said Mr. "
"Medill. But no ""ipsc dixit"" was ""authenticated"" to go "
to Senator Quay and make pledges. 

In the heat of the contest Joseph Medill was for making 
"pledges and bargains, as was done in 1860. But as Judge "
"Gresham was in Chicago, Mr. Medill readily saw from the "
"reports that came that no second-hand pledge would go, as "
it had in the case of Lincoln. Repeatedly he said and 
"wrote to Judge Gresham, to quote one of his letters : When "
Platt of New York and Quay of Pennsylvania arrive you 
are then the general to win the battle by capturing those 
"two leaders."" "

Senator Farwell wrote Judge Gresham from the Senate 
"chamber, June 5 (the convention met June 18): ""Platt is "
"here to-day, and I have promised him anything he wants "
"and will confirm it when we get to Chicago."" The same "
day Senator Teller of Colorado wrote from the Senate 



EVENTS PRIOR TO 1888 CONVENTION 577 

"chamber, ""Platt requests me to say to you he will call^on "
"you as soon as he gets to Chicago."" Senator Teller offered "
no pledges to Mr. Platt on this occasion; he thought Platt 
"ought to vote for Gresham without that, because Teller, "
"Platt, and Gresham had belonged to the same wing of the "
"Republican party, and because, as has been shown, Teller, "
"Gresham, and Senator Folger four years before had helped "
Platt back to power in New York. Senator Teller s letter 
"closed with the statement: ""Platt proposes to, and will, "
"demonstrate his power in Chicago."" "

A different order of man from Charles B. Farwell was 
Henry M. Teller. According to Senator Farwell s oral and 
"written communications, it was all a matter of bargain "
and trade. After it seemed that General Harrison s Chinese 
"record had destroyed his availability, and later, after Platt "
in the convention threw the Harrison people into conster 
"nation by threatening to vote no longer for Harrison, "
Farwell urged : New knows Harrison is a dead one ; make 
"your overtures to him."" None were made, arid there never "
"was any danger of what the Harrison people feared, a deal "
between Gresham and Platt. 

"In the ultimate analysis, because New York was a doubt "
"ful State while Pennsylvania was almost surely Republican, "
Thomas C. Platt was more influential than Senator Quay; 
"besides, he had been a Elaine man since 1884, and after "
"Mr. Elaine s quasi-withdrawal, Platt s relations with the "
Elaine people were cordial while Quay always was an 
opponent of Mr. Elaine. After he reached Chicago Mr. 
Platt let a few know what he wanted the Secretaryship 
of the Treasury. With Platt at the head of the Treasury 
Department and Quay chairman of the Republican National 
"Committee, the success he afterwards had shows there "
was reason for Senator Quay s belief that he would run 
"the National government, no matter w r ho might be Presi "
"dent. ""With Senator Plumb for you and every weekly "
Republican paper in Kansas and five of the Kansas dailies 



578 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"advocating your nomination,"" wrote a Republican from "
"Topeka, ""still New York is the key to the situation."" "
This unanimity in Kansas in 1888 will help to explain 
the upheaval in Kansas two years later. 

Thomas C. Platt had been one of the original Grant 
men in 1880. Elected in 1884 a delegate to the Chicago 
convention of that year by the aid of President Arthur s 
"friends but without pledges, Platt, instead of voting for "
"President Arthur s nomination, voted for Mr. Elaine. Had "
"Mr. Elaine been elected in 1884, T. C. Platt would have "
"been in his cabinet. Richard A. Elmer, one of the assistant "
postmaster-generals while Judge Gresham was in the Post 
"Office Department, and of the Platt order of ""Stalwarts,"" "
was a friend and correspondent of Judge Gresham in 1888. 
While Walter Q. Gresham was still in the Post Office Depart 
ment Mr. Elmer retired and organized the American Surety 
"Company, the first of its kind. By 1888 it had grown to a "
prosperous institution. ; There are Gresham men in the 
"New York delegation,"" wrote Mr. Elmer, ""but we can t "
"afford to go against his, Platt s, wishes; he controls four- "
"fifths of the delegates. . . . Not only that, Quay and "
"Platt are in harmony and Quay will trail Platt."" Qualified "
by capacity and experience in affairs for the Secretaryship 
"of the Treasury unless too close to Wall Street, as was "
"subsequently urged against him, Judge Gresham did not "
believe that any interest would have controlled Platt if he 
was made Secretary of the Treasury. But my husband 
said he would promise no man a place in the cabinet or 
"anywhere else. ""If I ever happen to be elected President,"" "
"he said, ""I will be as free as I was the day I stepped on "
"the bench."" "

In many ways Mr. Platt manifested his friendly interest. 
Before the Illinois State Convention met he sent word that 
"he had been to Washington, and in the inner circle of the "
State had learned that Senator Cullom w r ould not allow 
Gresham to have the solid vote of Illinois on the start. 



EVENTS PRIOR TO 1888 CONVENTION 579 

"This information was communicated to Joseph Medill, who "
"said and wrote the letter is still in existence ""John R. "
Tanner and Joseph Fifer will see that Senator Cullom gets 
"back into line."" Both Tanner and Fifer when mere boys "
"had graduated from the farm into the army, and at the "
close of the war had not reached their majority. Fifer was 
then the Republican candidate for Governor of Illinois. 
John R. Tanner was afterwards Governor of Illinois. He 
"was a man of decided ability and force, but withal had a "
power of suggestion that the best trained diplomat of 
Europe could not excel in delicacy. Senator Cullom did 
not break the Illinois delegation. Senator Farwell was 
opposed to instructing the Illinois delegation for Gresham. 
He wanted a trading delegation. In that event he would 
have been a principal. But Illinois was instructed for 
"Gresham, and Tanner said Gresham, in time and in turn, "
"should have asked Platt, What can we do for you ? "" That "
my husband earned the criticism of Tanner and others 
"that he was no politician, is here confessed. "

Senator Platt also sent word that Chauncey M. Depew 
"could not be nominated, that Mr. Depew knew this, and "
was also satisfied that he could not be elected if he should 
be nominated; that New York might not even give Depew 
a complimentary vote. Then came a proposition from New 
York that Mr. Depew s election to the Vice-Presidency 
"would not interfere with his corporate connections, and "
that he would consent to a ticket of Gresham and Depew. 
To this my husband failed to assent. 

"On the 2pth day of April, Mr. Platt sent word by Colonel "
"John W. Foster that of the men mentioned, Gresham was "
"his personal choice, and to look out for Pennsylvania, "
Quay would swing that State. 

"A few days before the Convention met, when all kinds "
"of rumors were flying about, and just after the papers had "
published a report that Mr. Platt had said Gresham should 
not be nominated because too many Mugwumps were for 



580 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"him,"" Mr. Platt sent a special messenger to my husband "
"to say that the report was untrue, and that he would come "
to no decision as to whom he would support for the nomi 
nation until he reached Chicago. 

"Meanwhile, Erastus Brainard was hammering away in "
his Philadelphia Daily News. As a Connecticut Yankee 
he said he was in touch with men in New England and 
New Jersey. He was something of a practical reformer. 
"He wrote McManus, one of the Philadelphia delegates, and "
"the other machine politicians of Philadelphia, that he would "
let up on them if they would support Gresham. They 
"agreed to do so. Then through Senator Farwell, Senator "
"Quay, on May 30, sent word that through this source "
Gresham would not get a single vote from Pennsylvania. 
On the gth of June Quay sent word to Joseph Medill that 
"he would be in Chicago Thursday night, the i3th, and "
"desired ""a meeting with Judge Gresham either the after "
"noon or evening of Friday, whichever suits the convenience "
"of the judge."" "

On the 1 2th John C. New brought the Harrison boom to 
Chicago and proceeded to say that under no circumstances 
should Gresham have a vote from Indiana. Charles W. 
"Fairbanks, the leader of the Gresham movement in Indiana, "
arrived at the same time. 

"Associated with Mr. Fairbanks, some of whom accom "
"panied him, were such men as Albert J. Beveridge, A. C. "
"Harris, Noble C. Butler, V. T. Malott, General A. D. "
"Streight, ex-Governor Thomas Hanna, George W. Wilson, "
"T. R. McDonald, H. C. Hanna, Andrew J. Penman, A. L. "
"Kumler, George M. Friedley, H. A. Orth, Moses Fowler, "
"Judge E. P. Hammond, A. W. Wishard, Charles A. Book- "
"waiter, Kenesaw M. Landis, Edward Daniels, and many "
others. William V. Rooker was one of Joseph Medill s 
"young newspaper men, afterwards a successful lawyer, who "
wrote some wonderful newspaper stories about Mr. Gresham 
that had been copied all over the country. Just at this 



EVENTS PRIOR TO 1888 CONVENTION 581 

time the papers stated that Governor Porter was giving 
General Harrison much anxiety at Indianapolis. 

"P. A. B. Widener was in Chicago on the i2th, and Quay, "
"as he had sent word, on the morning of the i3th. He "
"called on Judge Gresham at his chambers, but none of the "
"newspaper men mentioned it, although they all knew it. "
"They were all for Gresham, but seemed to think it was "
"policy to fail to mention that visit. They said, ""Senator "
Quay arrived in town yesterday and put in his time visit 
"ing friends around town."" Joseph Medill was greatly ex "
cited about it. 

vSenator Quay was in unison with Judge Gresham in 
"opposition to Mr. Elaine, did not object to my husband s "
"tariff views, but could not accept his desire to be free when "
it came to dispensing the loaves and fishes. On that Quay 
was insistent that there should be a definite understand 
"ing. ""That can not be,"" was the final answer. This did "
not mar the cordiality of the meeting. As one of President 
"Arthur s friends in Pennsylvania, Walter Q. Gresham had "
"become well acquainted with Quay. Erastus Brainard, the "
newspaper man to whom the judge said he would make no 
"deal, did not reach Chicago until Sunday morning. Ex- "
"Senator Platt, Mrs. Platt, and Rachel Sherman, one of "
"General Sherman s daughters, reached Chicago late Friday "
evening and stopped at the Grand Pacific Hotel. In an 
"interview, Mr. Platt declared he did not know ""what New "
"York would do in the convention."" "

Senator Sherman claims in his autobiography that Mr. 
Platt promised before he left New York to vote for and 
"throw his influence to Sherman. What inducement, if any, "
Senator Sherman held out to Mr. Platt he does not state. 
The mere presence of Senator Sherman s niece in Mr. Platt s 
party was not enough to warrant a man of affairs like Senator 
Sherman expecting the support of a cold-blooded politician 
"like Thomas C. Platt. Moreover, Platt gave as his reason "
for being against Senator Sherman that he was an Ohio 



582 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"man, and that ever since Platt s and Conkling s experience "
"with Garfield, he would not trust the pledge of an Ohio "
man. He always opposed McKinley. 

We were living at the Palmer House. I noticed that 
"my husband did not suggest my calling on Rachel Sherman, "
and I did not go. It would have involved including Mrs. 
Platt on my visit. Under other circumstances I would 
"have promptly called on Rachel Sherman and Mrs. Platt, "
although I had never met the latter. According to all 
"accounts, Mrs. Platt was a very estimable woman. "

The next Saturday Mr. Platt called on my husband and 
said he was still noncommittal on the Presidency. My 
"husband told Mr. Platt that he was as he had always been, "
opposed to Mr. Elaine on political lines; that he was 
opposed to taking the tax off tobacco as proposed by Mr. 
"Elaine, and off whiskey as proposed by Mr. Depew; that "
he favored the reduction of the surplus on the lines the 
party was committed to in the platform in 1884 and prior 
"thereto, by reducing the customs duties. ""I am for the "
kind of protection set forth in my New York speech in 
"1884, which you heard. That had been the policy of the "
branch of the party to which you and I belonged prior to 
1884. Elaine indorsed that speech. Now he and Depew 
would carry up beyond anything Henry Clay ever advo 
cated. The new r propaganda is a mistake and is not right. 
The scale of wages that made up the difference between 
the wages in this and foreign countries was sufficient. I 
know your relations to Mr. Elaine. I can make you no 
"such pledges as he has."" It was up to the Judge, as John "
"R. Tanner said, to introduce the subject, to make the offer "
of a place in the cabinet. Mr. Gresham took the most con 
"siderate way he knew, of refusing. They did not meet "
afterwards during the convention. But Quay came a 
"second time, and in this second visit he did not represent "
himself alone. From other States than New York and 
Pennsylvania were these pledges demanded. 



EVENTS PRIOR TO 1 S S S CONVENTION 583 

"Men like John S. McLain, of the Minneapolis Journal; "
"George Thompson, of the St. Paul Despatch; Robert J. "
"Evans and W. J. Freaney, and Henry W. Judson, professor "
"of political economy in the University of Minnesota, who "
led in the movement that practically instructed Minnesota 
"for Gresham; Colonel N"". H. Owings in Washington, and "
"W. T. Hume and the editor of the Orcgonian, who swung "
Oregon into line for Gresham; former Judge of the Supreme 
"Court Rhodes of California, and the California newspaper "
men; Senator Henry M. Teller in Colorado; Senator 
"Plumb of Kansas, and Colonel Walter Evans of Kentucky, "
never made a suggestion looking to patronage. 

"Men like Colonel Clark E. Carr of Illinois, who had been "
"in the 1860 convention, said Illinois was more unanimous for "
Gresham than it had been for Lincoln. The sentiment in 
"Wisconsin, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, "
"Colorado, California, Oregon, and the West, as well as in "
"New York, Pennsylvania, and New England, if the press "
"and private reports were any criterion, was also favorable. "
"Indiana was not far behind. In Wisconsin, Henry C. "
"Payne, one of the delegates-at-large from that State, wrote "
"Judge Dyer he was for Judge Gresham, and Senator John C. "
Spooner wrote Judge Bunn before he was elected a delegate 
that he would also support Judge Gresham. My husband 
did not agree with these judges. When asked how Sena 
"tor Sawyer stood towards him, he answered he thought he "
"would be opposed to him, for there was the Angle case. "
"Payne, Spooner, Sawyer, and Governor Rusk made Rusk "
a candidate only to hold delegates from Gresham. They 
all knew Rusk \vas not a possibility. 

That Depew with his railroad influences reached into 
"Wisconsin and even other States is true, but that they "
would not have been potent against T. C. Platt is equally 
true. In the end Depew would have followed Platt. Such 
was Senator Sherman s opinion. An analysis of the vote in 
the conventions of 1888 and of 1892 shows Platt s control.

NATIONAL COMMITTEE HARRISON S STRENGTH GENERAL 

HARRISON NOMINATED. 

"ON Monday, June 17, 1888, at the first formal meeting "
"of the Republican National Committee, there was a "
contest as to who would be presented for the temporary 
"chairman to the National Convention, to meet at noon the "
following day. For a time it had been supposed the com 
mittee would recommend M. M. Estee of California for 
the position. Mr. Estee had opposed the Southern Pacific 
"Company in California, then gave it his allegiance, and "
"came to Chicago as an ostensible anti-monopoly man,"" "
"as one of his friends put it, but really a Southern Pacific "
"agent. Only a short time before the committee met, "
"John M. Thurston, one of the delegates-at-large from "
"Nebraska, and the general counsel of the Union Pacific "
"Railroad Company, was also put forward for temporary "
"chairman. Much to Mr. Estee s surprise, the committee "
"voted evenly, 20 to 20. Benjamin F. Jones, chairman of "
"the National Committee, decided the controversy by casting "
his vote for Mr. Thurston. 

Subsequent events made it plain there was significance 
"in the protest, on the floor of the Convention, of the chair "
"man of the Kansas delegation, B. F. Osborne, on behalf "
"of his State, against the report of the National Committee "

584



REPUBLICAN CONVENTION OF 18 88 585 

"in naming a ""railroad attorney"" for temporary chairman "
of the convention. 

Mr. Thtirston was a forceful and eloquent speaker. In 
the mutations of politics he became a United States senator 
"from Nebraska, and closed his days as a lobbyist at Wash "
ington. 

There were speeches from Fred Douglass and John C. 
Fremont and then an adjournment until noon of Wednes 
"day, to give ample time, as it was reported, for the Com "
mittee on Resolutions to get the platform in the desired 
shape. There was a hesitancy about committing the party 
to an unprecedented extreme. 

"When the Convention met on Wednesday, the Com "
mittee on Permanent Organization was not ready to report 
because of the delay in the Committee on Resolutions. 
"Instead of adjourning again, it w r as decided to make Mr. "
Estee permanent chairman and receive the report of the 
"Committee on Credentials, which recommended the settle "
ment of the contest between Congressman John S. Wise 
"of Virginia and General William Mahone, an ex-Senator "
of the same State. This contest had interested everybody. 
General Mahone had undertaken to keep Mr. Wise out of 
the Convention by electing all the delegates from the State 
"of Virginia at a convention held at Petersburgh, instead of "
"the district delegates by local conventions. ""Mr. Wise and "
"his colleague were elected at a district convention, in accord "
"ance with the call of the National Committee, and were "
given their seats. He and his associate voted for Gresham 
on the first three ballots. General Mahone was for John 
Sherman. 

"At the session of June 21, the third day after the con "
"vention had been organized, the Committee on Resolutions "
reported. In the report of the Committee on Permanent 
Organization were the names of the members of the new 
National Committee. Matthew S. Quay appeared as the 
"member from Pennsylvania. As before intimated, it had "



586 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

been previously decided or agreed with Platt that Quay 
should be the chairman of the new committee when it 
"organized, no matter who might be nominated. And the "
way Quay used his power after he came into the saddle will 
be part of our story. William McKinley read the platform 
report of the Committee on Resolutions. Its chief feature 
was the tariff. That part of it began : 

We are unconditionally in favor of the American system of 
protection. We protest against its destruction proposed by the 
President and his party. 

"It denounced the Mills bill, and free wool as proposed "
"in it, the Democratic measure then pending before Congress. "
If there still remain a larger revenue than is requisite for 
"the wants of the government, we favor the entire repeal "
of internal taxes (by repealing the tax on tobacco and 
on spirits used in the arts) rather than the surrender of 
any part of our protective system at the joint behest of the 
"whiskey trusts and the agents of foreign manufacturers."" "

"Indeed, as one of the reporters that morning quoted "
"William McKinley, it was a progressive platform. Even "
Mr. Elaine in his famous interview had not come squarely 
"out for ""free whiskey."" It was a repudiation of the plat "
form of 1884. 

"As soon as Walter Q. Gresham read it in his chambers, "
"he wrote a letter to Senator Farwell, asking that his name "
"be withdrawn from the Convention, and then started out "
"to find Joseph Medill. Just outside of the building, he met "
"Mr. Medill, who was on his way to find Judge Gresharn. "
"Medill began the conversation. ""I suppose you don t "
"like the platform?"" ""No,"" was the response, ""and I have "
a letter here to Senator Farwell requesting that my name 
"does not go before the Convention."" Then at the earnest "
"request of Mr. Medill, on his representation that it would "
"embarrass him and other friends, and at the request of "
"others, the letter was destroyed. Had Mr. Medill "".stood "



REPUBLICAN CONVENTION OF 1888 587 

"by his guns"" that platform would have been modified, or "
at least we never would have had the McKinley Tariff 
"Act, and its like, the Dingley Act, which William McKinley, "
in his last words to the American people on that fatal day 
"he was shot, said should be modified. "

Yielding to the importunities of friends and keeping 
"silent on this occasion, laid my husband open to the charge "
of inconsistency when he did speak out four years later. 
"Frank Hatton was the leader in this charge. He said, "
Gresham had been willing to accept a nomination at the 
"hands of the party that adopted the 88 platform."" Mr. "
Hatton knew Judge Gresham never would have accepted 
"that platform, and also that if he had agreed in advance "
"to make Thomas C. Platt Secretary of the Treasury, he "
could have said what he pleased in his letter of acceptance. 
This attack of Mr. Hatton s it was part of his newspaper 
"business, he was then editing the Washington Post did "
not disturb our friendly relations. 

But never did there ever come a word of criticism from 
either Thomas C. Platt or Matthew S. Quay that there 
was any deception on Mr. Gresham s part in dealing with 
them or that he wanted the nomination on the platform 
that was adopted. And afterwards Mr. Platt showed his 
kindly feelings for me in many ways. 

"If Judge Gresham is nominated, said John R. Cow- "
"dry, Union Labor nominee for President, ""I will withdraw "
"and he will poll the labor vote of the country."" At the "
"same time, M. H. De Young, the member of the National "
"Committee from California, was saying: ""Allison, Sher "
"man, and Harrison cannot carry the Pacific slope because "
"of their Chinese records."" "

"In the meantime, the representatives of the Central "
Labor Union of Indianapolis visited the various State 
headquarters and protested against General Harrison s 
nomination because they said he was hostile to labor or 
ganizations. They extended their objections to John C. New 



588 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"and to Editor Halford, because the Indianapolis Journal "
"under their management was an open, or ""rat shop."" "

"Thursday evening there was a great Gresham ""Tin "
"Bucket"" parade. Actual laboring men from Fort Wayne "
"and LaFayette, from the mills of South Chicago, represent "
"atives of ""Little Italy,"" and the immigrants of every other "
"nationality in Chicago, under the leadership of William "
"Lorimer of Chicago, George W. Wilson of Fort Wayne, and "
Albert W. Wishard and Joseph B. Kealing of Indianapo- 
"Hs, marched the streets, through the hotels and into the "
"political headquarters of the New York, Pennsylvania, and "
"other large State delegations. They said, ""We represent the "
"votes."" Each man carried a dinner pail. This parade, the "
"assaults of the newspapers on the ""free whiskey platform,"" "
"telegrams from prominent people at home, speeches from "
"men like Colonel R. G. Ingersoll, Albert J. Beveridge, "
"Colonel DeWitt C. Wallace, and others, to each State "
"delegation in turn, showing how easy it would be to elect "
"Gresham, brought the representatives of the special inter "
ests and the practical politicians to their knees. 

"Following the ""Tin Bucket"" parade Senator Quay made "
"his second visit to Judge Gresham, but without exacting "
any pledges. The ground swell was so strong that even 
Joseph Medill was for a time converted to the idea that 
"the lone hand would win. But his candidate told him, "
No. And then the old man went back to the conven 
"tional methods, but could not get his candidate to make "
"the desired pledges. H. A. Orth, a son of the old congress "
"man, had promised some of the West Virginia delegates "
all the offices they wanted if they would vote for his candi 
"date, Judge Gresham. They said, ""All right, let s go arid "
"call on the Judge."" The call was made and in the pres "
ence of Orth the West Virginians bluntly asked if his agree 
"ments would be honored. The Judge answered, ""While "
"Mr. Orth is my friend, I cannot make any agreements as "
"to the future."" In telling of the incident, Mr. Orth said, "



REPUBLICAN CONVENTION OF 1888 589 

"If Judge Gresham had not been in Chicago, I would have "
"held my men."" "

"Chauncey M. Depew told the railroad men, ""Nominate "
"Gresham, and he will Wabash all of us."" Thomas C. "
Platt talked of nominating Alger and Depew. Senator 
"Teller, in meeting this talk, did not mince words. The "
"nomination of Alger, who had nothing but money, and "
"Depew, who was smirched with lobbying and corrupting "
the New York legislature with Erie and New York Central 
"money, would be a disgrace, he said. General Harrison, "
"he said, could not be elected because of the opposition of "
the labor and greenback vote. 

When the Harrison managers secretly brought forward 
the alleged speech of Judge Gresham against the Germans 
"at Lowden s School House in Harrison County in 1855, "
German editors and Germans from Harrison County said 
it was not true. 

The proceedings of the Convention show how it was 
manipulated. After the platform was adopted the roll of 
the States was called for nominations. 

"Illinois, through Leonard Swett, who had been one of "
"Abraham Lincoln s friends, presented the name of Walter "
Q. Gresham. It was seconded by C. K. Davis of Minne 
"sota, John R. Lynch, the colored man from Natchez, "
"Mississippi, and Samuel W. McCall of Massachusetts. "

Ex-Governor Albert G. Porter presented the name of 
"General Benjamin Harrison of Indiana, and he gave an "
admirable delineation of General Harrison s character and 
"ability, but, doubtless thinking of Garfield in 1880, he "
"dwelt on the fact that in 1880, when Indiana was an October "
"State, Albert G. Porter, as a candidate for governor against "
"a united party with a State candidate for Vice-President, "
"had carried the State by a plurality of 7,000, while General "
Harrison in 1876 as the Republican candidate for governor 
"had lost the State by the same ratio, and that Mr. Elaine "
had met a similar fate in 1884. This thrust at General 



590 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN ORE SHAM 

Harrison and kind allusion to Judge Gresham threw Gen 
eral Harrison s managers into consternation. But what was 
"most important, the Quays and Platts accepted this speech "
of Governor Porter s as official notification that soon he 
and a large majority of the Indiana vote would be cast for 
"Gresham. It was this speech, supplemented by the march "
"of the Tin Bucket Brigade,"" that sent Quay scurrying "
to Gresham. There was not the danger that Quay and 
"Platt thought. While Albert G. Porter was a ""dark horse "" "
"candidate ""no pony,"" as one of the practical men put it - "
he was willing to compromise on a place in the cabinet. 

Failing to get an understanding with the popular candi 
"date, the practical men brought into play all the arts that "
in a previous National convention had diverted votes to 
favorite sons who were utterly unavailable to go before the 
people. One of the old tricks of a National convention to 
weaken a strong candidate and keep a weak one in the 
"field was to loan the latter votes. Senator Quay, who had "
"posed as being for Senator John Sherman, made good his "
word that he was really committed to no one. He and 
three other of his Pennsylvania delegates actually voted 
"on the first ballot for William Walter Phelps of New Jersey, "
as a means of holding the New Jersey delegates to Phelps. 
"At the last minute Mayor Fitler of Philadelphia, who had "
"never before been heard of as a Presidential possibility, was "
brought out and voted for by the delegates from Phila 
delphia. And thus it was that Senator Quay prevented 
any of the Philadelphia delegates from keeping their prom 
ise to Brainerd to vote for Gresham. 

E. H. Terrell of Texas and Jacob H. Gallinger of New 
"Hampshire, seconded the nomination of General Harrison. "

"Iowa, by W. P. Hepburn, presented the name of Senator "
W. B. Allison. It was seconded by B. U. Bos worth of 
Rhode Island. 

"Michigan, by R. E. Frazier, presented the name of "
General R. A. Alger. It was seconded by C. J. Noyes of 



REPUBLICAN CONVENTION OF isss 5 gr 

"Massachusetts, Patrick Egan of Nebraska, T. E. Estes "
"of North Carolina, and L. F. Eggers of the Territory of "
Arizona. 

"Meantime, there had been an adjournment from one "
o clock to three. That it was not decided until the last to 
put Mr. Depew in nomination was the belief at the time. 
It was also understood that Governor Porter s speech nomi 
nating General Harrison was the circumstance that finally 
determined this move. The Convention was showing signs 
of getting away from the practical men. At the adjourned 
"session, Senator Frank H. Hiscock, on behalf of New York, "
"nominated Mr. Depew. It was seconded by G. G. Hartley, "
"as he said, on behalf of one of the congressional districts of "
Minnesota. 

Senator John Sherman of Ohio was presented to the 
"convention by Pennsylvania, by General H. D. Hastings, "
"and seconded by Governors J. B. Foraker of Ohio, and "
Anson of North Carolina. 

"Charles E. Smith of Philadelphia, despite objections "
"from other Pennsylvania delegates, presented the name of "
Mayor E. H. Fitler of Philadelphia. 

Senator John C. Spooner closed the nominations by 
presenting the name of Governor J. H. Rusk of Wisconsin. 
It was 8 o clock in the evening when the convention ad 
journed until ii A. M. Friday for the balloting. 

"There were eight ballots in all- - three on Friday, the "
"22d, two on Saturday, the 2^d, and three on Monday, the "
25th. It is to be remembered that several men who were 
not even nominated were voted for as favorite sons. 

"Following the announcement of the third ballot, the "
Convention adjourned until 8 p. M. At the evening session 
Mr. Depew withdrew his name. But before the adjourn 
"ment, Colonel George R. Davis, one of the Illinois delegates, "
secured the adoption of a motion that Colonel R. G. Inger- 
soll be invited to address the assembly after the adjourn 
"ment. As soon as the Convention adjourned, many of the "

REPUBLICAN CONVENTION OF 1888 593 

delegates went out. The galleries were crowded. Colonel 
"Ingersoll started in with his old-time eloquence, but soon "
bluntly declared he was for Gresham. This created a great 
"commotion. A demonstration was begun for Gresham, a "
"counter one for Mr. Blaine, some of the New York dele "
"gates started to leave, and Colonel Ingersoll was not per "
mitted to continue his speech. It was claimed Colonel 
Ingersoll violated the proprieties of the occasion by men 
tioning the name of a single man. His answer was that 
"it was a mass meeting, and as a member of that body he "
"was for only a single man. ""I was talking to Tom Platt "
"right down there before me, and he knew it. And he knew "
"I had a lot more to say."" Some papers said this was a "
great mistake on Ingersoll s part and ruined Gresham s 
"chances, but this was untrue. It really helped him, for "
after that Platt made overtures. 

Within an hour Mr. Gresham walked past Thomas 
C. Platt s rooms in the Grand Pacific Hotel to Colonel and 
Mrs. Ingersoll s apartment and thanked Colonel Ingersoll 
for his speech. Platt and the men on the inside with their 
spies knew of this. 

In the last chapter we copied from the letter of Colonel 
"Ingersoll of May 18, 1888, in which he advised that a "
promise be given to make James G. Blaine Secretary of 
State. In nominating Mr. Blaine for the Presidency in 
"1876 at Cincinnati, the speech of Colonel Ingersoll was "
"the best ever made in a National convention, and Elaine s "
nomination was prevented only by adjourning the conven 
tion. This was brought about by some one asserting in a 
loud voice that as there were no lights and it was getting 
"dark, they must wait until morning to vote. Meantime, "
the art of handling a great convention had been advanced. 
When Colonel Ingersoll reached Chicago and the Judge 
explained it was not necessary for him to consider Mr. 
"Blaine which was not unpleasant news to Ingersoll, for "
he had broken with Blaine but that he would have to 



594 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"make pledges to Platt and Quay, ""which I will not do"" "
the Colonel promptly approved the Judge s morals and 
"said, ""I will go down with you."" "

"Before he made his final speech, Colonel Ingersoll made "
a score of speeches to the crowds and various State dele 
"gations. Many thought that Ingersoll, Albert J. Beveridge, "
"and the other orators, and the ""Tin Bucket Brigade,"" were "
carrying the delegates off their feet. There were men in 
"the New York delegation, old friends of President Arthur "
"and ex-Senator Conkling, who favored the nomination of "
"Judge Gresham. Senator Henry M. Teller of Colorado, a "
"native son of New York, was on the ground, pleading with "
these men in the New York delegation to vote their real 
"sentiments, and telling them how he and Judge Gresham "
had made it possible for Platt to come back four years 
before. 

"That Friday afternoon H. H. Porter, the railroad man "
"in the Angle case, went into the First National Bank where "
"Samuel Allerton, S. K. Nickerson, Lyman J. Gage, and the "
"other capitalists were assembled, and said that Judge "
"Gresham was a dangerous man, and if something was n t "
"done, he would be nominated. But Gresham and Ingersoll "
knew better. 

"On Friday, before Depew withdrew, and before a single "
New York vote had been cast for General Harrison. Thomas 
"C. Platt says that General Harrison, in the event of his "
"election, in consideration of Platt casting his New York "
"votes for him, promised through L. T. Michener, then "
"Attorney-General of Indiana, to make Platt Secretary of "
the Treasury. Mr. Platt was supported in his statement 
"by Senator Frank Hiscock, J. S. Fassett, and James S. "
Clarkson. As evidence of Michener s authority to make 
"this pledge, Mr. Platt said Mr. Michener delivered to him, "
"Platt, the following autograph letter, which Platt published "
when he was not appointed Secretary of the Treasury: 



REPUBLICAN CONVENTION OF 1888 595 

"INDIANAPOLIS, June 12, 1888 "

"HON. L. T. MICHENER, "
MY DEAR SIR: 

"I have to-day, and heretofore, fully explained to you my "
"views upon certain questions, and you are authorized on occasion "
to explain them to other friends. 

"Sincerely yours, "

BENJAMIN HARRISON. 

Henry M. Teller never forgave Mr. Platt for going over 
to Blaine in 1884. And when the time came to deliver the 
"goods, Teller was one of the senators who helped prevent "
the consummation of the 1888 deal. He served notice on 
President-elect Harrison that he and the other silver sena 
"tors would prevent the confirmation of ""a gold bug"" like "
ex-Senator Platt as Secretary of the Treasury. Joseph Me- 
dill promised to aid Mr. Teller to make good his threats. 

"Always on good terms with Thomas C. Platt, after the "
"entire story came out, Robert G. Ingersoll often rubbed it "
"into the ""Easy Boss"": ""Now, Thomas, if you were only "
"Secretary of the Treasury, we would not be in this awful "
"silver muss."" "

"That Friday night, or rather between i and 2 A. M., at "
a caucus in the Gresham headquarters in the Grand Pacific 
"Hotel, after it had been agreed by Thomas C. Platt to give "
"General Harrison ""part of the New York delegates,"" it was "
"decided there should be no nomination on that day, Satur "
"day, but that the convention should adjourn until Monday. "
Mr. Platt was not present at this caucus but was repre 
"sented by Stephen B. French, one of the New York City "
delegates. There were present Senator Charles B. Farwell 
"and George R. Davis of the Illinois Delegation, Senator "
"Quay, Senator Aldrich of Rhode Island, and representatives "
"from California, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and Michigan. "
Senator Farwell was made chairman of this meeting. 

"While this caucus was in progress, Patrick Ford, another "



596 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"of Plait s lieutenants, was telling John C. New, in the "
"Harrison headquarters in the Grand Pacific Hotel, that "
General Harrison s Chinese record and his antipathy to the 
Irish would certainly lose him New York if he should be 
"nominated. Ford, it was said, worked Mr. New up to a "
"great state of excitement, but it was nothing to compare "
with the consternation he produced the next night in the 
Harrison headquarters. 

In those days the real work of a National convention 
was often done by a few men in a caucus. At a later and 
"smaller caucus, of which the newspapers did not even get "
"a trace, or at least made no mention, Quay proposed to "
"nominate Major McKinley. All agreed but Platt, and his "
objection prevailed. He afterwards said his reason w r as 
"that, after the experience with Garfield in 1880, he never "
would trust an Ohio man s pledge in a National conven 
"tion. Partly out of resentment, Platt opposed McKinley s "
"nomination in 1896, when it was patent long in advance "
"that it was inevitable; but he was also a man of ideas, and "
this was one of the means of forcing the McKinley men to the 
adoption of the gold standard in the platform of that year. 

"The Convention met on Saturday at n A. M., and "
there were two more ballots. 

Stephen B. French and thirteen others of the New 
York delegates withheld their votes from General Har 
rison and scattered them for Blaine and other candidates. 

At two in the afternoon the Convention took a recess 
"to four, and then adjourned, by a vote of 492 to 316. "
to Monday morning. New York voted solidly against ad 
"journment. As to what this meant, Mr. E. W. Halford "
"stated in his telegram to his paper, the Indianapolis Jour "
"nal, that appeared by special train the next morning in "
"Chicago: ""New York s support of General Harrison will be "
"withdrawn on Monday. Platt, George R. Davis, chair "
"man of the Illinois delegation, the Calif ornians who are "
"making believe for Blaine, form the combine that controls "

"the convention."" George R. Davis had been elected the "
Illinois member of the National Committee and it was 
"then known that he would be, as he subsequently was, a "
"member of its Executive Committee, with Senator Quay as "
"its chairman. Mr. Halford further said: ""As I intimated, "
the action of New York was more of a feint than a sincer 
"ity, and was not permitted to go beyond the point where "
"it could be controlled."" "



598 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN ORE SHAM 

As to New York voting solidly against adjournment at 
"4 P. M., as French, Platt s representative,"" had at 2 A. M. "
of the same day agreed that the Convention should be 
"adjourned without a nomination, Mr. Halford said in "
"this dispatch to the folks at home: ""New York skilfully "
"voted No, still further to throw dust in the eyes of the "
"delegates and the people."" And finally, after saying, ""I "
do not pretend to know who they will nominate on Mon 
"day,"" voiced his heart s desire, ""I do not think they will "
"nominate Gresham."" "

Immediately upon the adjournment cf the Convention 
Thomas C. Platt and Matthew Stanley Quay caused the 
"report to be circulated throughout the crowds, the corri "
"dors of the hotel, and the delegates, that at the next session "
"of the Convention, on Monday, New York s seventy -two "
votes would be cast for some other candidate than General 
Harrison. Stephen B. French was one of the men through 
whom Platt spoke. Patrick Ford was another. Again 
"Ford called on John C. New. ""Your man is a dead one,"" "
"he said. ""We have given you New 7 York s vote to-day, "
and with that you cannot scrape up enough votes to 
"nominate. You had ample time to make your alliances."" "
"According to one newspaper man s report, Ford s talk "
made New frantic. 

"Quay, still professing to be for Sherman, to keep the "
"Pennsylvanians from going to McKinley, told the New "
"Jersey people, ""On Monday New York will vote for Elaine "
"and Elaine will be nominated."" This was carried directly "
"to the Harrison headquarters. Saturday afternoon, Sena "
tor Platt began again his flirtation with the Gresham people. 
"That very afternoon and Saturday night, and afterwards. "
"Platt said, ""Gresham will be the easiest of all to elect."" "
"Again Senator Far well, Joseph Medill, William Penn Nixon, "
and George R. Davis wanted pledges made. 

I was present when Mr. Medill called on Judge Gresham 
"and said, ""We can nominate you now if you will only let "



REPUBLICAN CONVENTION OF 1SSS 599 

"me say you will stand as the platform is written."" ""Not "
"for the Presidency, Mr. MediU, with my consent can you "
"make such a statement about me."" The same was said to "
William Perm Nixon when he called and stated he wanted 
to make a similar statement in the Chicago Intcr-Occan. 

Thomas C. Platt understood Walter O. Gresham \s po 
sition thoroughly. His pretended overtures that Saturday 
afternoon and night and Sunday morning were a feint. He 
knew that they would not be accepted. But they produced 
consternation in the Harrison and Blaine camps. John 
"C. New could not eat any dinner that Saturday evening, "
"and, declared the newspaper boys, he said if Gresham was "
nominated he would sell out his Indianapolis Journal and 
all his Indianapolis property. Platt s New York delegates 
"transferred to Gresham, would have transferred to him all "
but Editor Halford s vote and that of two or three other of 
"the Indiana delegates. John Overmeyer, one of the Indi "
"ana delegates, was saying, ""I have voted my last ballot for "
Harrison. Under the arrangement with the Harrison men 
"on the delegation made with me, they must reciprocate on "
"Monday and vote for Gresham."" If you don t believe "
"John Overmeyer was a practical politician, go back and "
read the Jennings County case. 1 

"By holding up the specter of his rival s nomination, "
"Platt could not force Gresham to make a pledge. ""The "
"biggest coward on earth is the man who is afraid to lose."" "
But when he suggested to the Harrison people that Gresham 
"would make a most available candidate, Mr. Platt says he "
got the further assurances he wanted. While Platt s closest 
friends in the New York delegation were telling the boys 
"on Sunday morning they would not vote for Harrison, and "
"that they would not need ""Chauncey s money with Gresham "
"to make a campaign in New York"" (Depew had said that if "
"Gresham was nominated, no money could be raised for the "
"ticket in New York), the wily Stephen B. Elkins, with Mrs. "

ISee page 477. 



6oo LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"Elkins, took Mr. Platt and Mrs. Platt for a Sunday morn "
"ing ride. Instead of going to church, they drove to Lin "
"coln Park. As they drove along, Mr. Elkins said, ""Platt "
"was very uncommunicative"" until he (Elkins) showed him "
a letter from General Harrison and the telegram of Mr. 
"Elaine, received that morning, in which Mr. Elaine said "
that Elkins was authorized to withdraw his name should 
"it be presented the next day. Then, he said, Platt agreed "
to support Harrison on the morrow. He said he did not 
promise Platt on behalf of Harrison that Platt would be 
Secretary of the Treasury. Platt claimed Elkins made 
"that promise, and that the letter of General Harrison to "
Mr. Elkins authorized the latter to speak for the former. 
Both the letter and the telegram Mr. Elkins retained in 
his own possession and never produced them. 

At a caucus of the New r York delegation that Sunday 
"afternoon, Mr. Platt later stated that he told the New York "
delegation of the renewed pledge to make him Secretary of 
"the Treasury, and then it was he said they for the first "
"time unanimously agreed to support General Harrison, as "
"they did on the morrow, Monday morning, when General "
Harrison was nominated. 

"In his report to the Indianapolis Journal on Tuesday, "
"June 26, of how the nomination came about the day before, "
Editor Halford said: 

Every friend of General Harrison should feel kindly towards 
"Mr. Elkins, and indeed towards all the close friends of Blame, as "
"well as towards the splendid New York delegation, whose candor "
"and unanimity, misunderstood for a time, probably, really dic "
tated the nomination of Harrison. 

Who was this splendid New York delegation ? Certainly 
"not Chauncey M. Depew, who it is said had arranged long "
in advance with Steve Elkins for General Harrison s nomi 
nation. Doubtless Chauncey and Stephen thought they 
"had settled it long in advance, but Thomas C. Platt cer- "



REPUBLICAN CONVENTION OF 1888 601 

tainly changed the status of affairs after the Convention 
"met, and made good the word that Senator Henry M. "
Teller sent from the United States Senate Chamber to 
"Judge Gresham, that Platt would show his power in the "
convention. In 1892 in the Minneapolis convention Platt 
voted forty-five of New York s seventy-two votes against 
"Harrison s renomination, with Mr. Depew on the ground "
"marshaling, to use one of Platt s expressions, ""the bread "
"and butter brigade,"" or the officeholders. "

In 1888 the Secretaryship of the Treasury was in every 
body s mind. In nominating Levi P. Morton of New York 
"for the Vice-Presidency, ex-Senator Warren Miller of New "
"York said: ""New York now not only has the Presidency "
"but also the Secretary of the Treasury."" "

It was in the early days of the convention that Platt 
had agreed that if Senator Miller would vote as he desired 
"in the Convention, when they got home, Platt would nom "
inate Warren Miller for governor. Platt kept his word 
"with Miller, and that was all Miller got, for Quay, as chair "
"man of the National Committee, traded Miller off for votes "
for Harrison and Morton. 

"Before the delegates left Chicago, General Harrison tele "
graphed that he wanted as his representative on the National 
"Committee, General W. W. Dudley, soon to become famous "
"or infamous as the author of the ""Blocks of Five"" letter. "

PEALED. 

WALTER Q. GRESHAM was not the disappointed 
man some people attempted to make him out to have 
been over the 1888 Convention. He was never in better 
health and spirits since he had recovered from his wound; 
indeed he thought he had made a most fortunate escape 
from being traded into a nomination on a platform upon 
which he could not stand. 

Albert G. Porter and John Sherman were the sore men 
who came out of that convention. Mr. Porter refused to 
become the Republican candidate for Governor of Indiana 
"for fear he might, as one of General Harrison s friends said, "
"pull Ben through in Indiana. Instead, General A. P. "
Hovey was nominated on a platform written by Editor Hal- 
ford. This State platform demanded honest elections and 
condemned the Democratic frauds of two years before against 
"the election franchise, especially the tall) 7 sheet forgeries. "

"As candidate for President in 1888, General Harrison s "
forensic ability came into good play. He received at In 
dianapolis many delegations both from Indiana and other 
"States, and met them with short, eloquent addresses. Eco "
"nomic conditions, the charge that the platform he was at "
tempting to stand on was a free whiskey one the Pro 
hibitionists led by Colonel Eli F. Ritter 1 were coming strong 
"forced General Harrison, as the candidate of his party, to "

l See page 389- 

602



THE BLOCKS OF FIVE CASE 603 

"abandon its platform, and to say that the tariff should be "
"reduced. ""The only question is,"" he said, ""shall it be re "
"duced by its friends or its enemies. We will reduce it."" "
"As will appear later on, ""General Harrison could talk but "
"could not act."" Four years later, in stating in an open "
"letter his intention to vote for Grover Cleveland, Judge "
"Gresham adverted to ""the pledge on the stump."" "

But notwithstanding General Harrison s admirable pre 
"sentation of the Republican side during the dog days, "
"when the sixty-day poll of Indiana was taken, that is, an "
enumeration of all the voters in the State sixty days before 
"the election, it showed Mr. Cleveland had Indiana by a "
considerable plurality. Then it was that General Harrison 
"appealed to Senator Quay, chairman of the Republican "
"Committee, for funds. Senator Quay sent word back that "
the electoral vote of New York would be cast for Harrison 
"and Morton, that General Harrison s friends had pledged the "
vote of Indiana to the Republican party if he was nominated 
"at Chicago, that he would be held to that pledge, and the "
National Committee had no funds for him to use in Indiana. 

"This answer of Senator Quay, General Harrison com "
"municated to his party friends in Indiana, as a reason why "
"they should again ""go down into their pockets."" After a "
"conference, James N. Huston, chairman of the Indiana "
"State Central Committee, appeared in Chicago and said "
Indiana was lost unless they had money. He was reminded 
of what had been said in General Harrison s behalf in June 
"before, that if General Harrison was nominated, he and his "
"friends would carry Indiana without outside aid. ""No "
"matter what we said then, Indiana will vote for Cleveland "
"next month unless we get money in the meantime,"" was "
Mr. Huston s reply. Chicago gave Mr. Huston all the 
money he asked for. 

"September 21, John C. New, the member of the National "
"Committee from Indiana, at Omaha, where he was solicit "
"ing funds to be used in Indiana in November, said, ""A "



604 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"complete poll shows where the floaters are, and you can "
"depend on it we will not lose any of that element."" "

"On October 31, there appeared in the Indianapolis Sen "
"tinel, the Democratic organ, the famous Dudley ""Blocks of "
"Five"" letter, dated at New York, October 24, 1888. The "
letter was written on stationery of the Republican National 
"Committee, and its most material parts follow: "

HEADQUARTERS REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE 
91 FIFTH AVENUE 

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 

"S. Quay, Chairman J. S. Clarkson, Vice-Chairman "

"J. S. Fassett, Secretary Wm. W. Dudley, Treasurer "

John C. New A. L. Conger 

G. A. Hobart Samuel Fessenden 

George R. Davis J. Manchester Haynes 

M. H. De Young Wm. Cassius Goodloe 

"DEAR SIR: New York, Oct. 24, 1888 "

I hope you have kept copies of the lists sent me. Such infor 
mation is very valuable and can be used to great advantage. It 
has enabled me to demonstrate to friends here that with proper 
"assistance, Indiana is surely Republican for Governor and Presi "
"dent, and has resulted, as I hoped it would, in securing for Indiana "
the aid necessary. Your committee will certainly receive from 
Chairman Huston the assistance necessary to hold our floaters 
"and doubtful voters, and gain enough of the other side to give "
"Harrison and Morton 10,000 plurality. . . . Divide the floaters "
"into blocks of five, and put a trusted man with necessary funds "
in charge of these five and make him responsible that none get 
away and that all vote our ticket. 

That afternoon there appeared in the Indianapolis 
"News, which was supporting General Harrison, a letter "
"from State Chairman Huston, in which he said: Colonel "
Dudley has nothing to do with the management of the In 
"diana campaign."" In so far as the letter suggested im "
"proper means, Mr. Huston said he repudiated it. Then "
"editorially, the News said: "



THE BLOCKS OF FIVE CASE 605 

It is the letter of a scoundrel. We do not believe that Colonel 
Dudley wrote it; we have always regarded him as an honest 
"man. But if he did write it, he is a scoundrel. The letter is a "
plain invitation to debauch the suffrage. 

Sim Coy s crime was not greater. He simply did by brutal 
"forgery what is here sought by corrupting others. If anything, "
"this is worse, for it creates a purchasable quantity, to be turned "
loose to act and react on every election. 

There had been no disloyalty in the Republican organi 
zation. The curiosity of a Democratic railway mail agent 
on the Ohio &amp; Mississippi Railroad from Cincinnati to St. 
"Louis, now a part of the B. &amp; O. system, who believed in "
those days of corruption that his party allegiance was par 
"amount to his official duty, caused him to open one of the "
"many letters of a certain kind passing through his hands, "
bearing the stamp of the Republican National Committee. 
"Seeing its importance as a political document, this official, "
"or good loyal Democrat, took it to the chairman of the "
Democratic State Central Committee of Indiana. The 
"name of this clerk never was publicly disclosed, nor that of "
"the addressee, a well-known practical politician. Mean "
while a list was made by the Democratic railway mail clerk 
of the addresses of all similar letters passing through the 
mails. The total was large. 

"The simultaneous appearance of the Dudley letter, with "
screaming headlines in all the leading newspapers of the 
"country, for a time rattled Chairman Quay l - the only "
time Matthew Stanley was ever perturbed in a political 
"battle."" He told Dudley: ""You have made a mistake in "
attempting to deal with any one in Indiana except Chair 
"man Huston of the Indiana State Central Committee."" "
"The fact is, Dudley was dealing with the de facto chairman, "
one of General Harrison s ipse dixits at Chicago. Two 
"years later, Mr. Michener became General Dudley s law "
partner at Washington and that relation continued until 
"Dudley s death. Recovering his equanimity, Quay said: "

!See page 651. 



606 LIFE OF WALTER Q U I N T I N G R E S H A M 

Another Democratic lie! And although it was an auto 
"graph letter, Colonel Dudley denounced it as a forgery and "
promptly instituted suits for libel against the New York 
"World, Post, Times, and Commercial Advertiser. When the "
World obtained an order for his examination under oath 
"as to who wrote the letter, he dismissed his suits. "

Quay s next move was to put the former famous secret 
"agent of the Treasury, E. G. Rathburn, on the case, and "
soon they knew the name of the mail clerk. Then Senator 
Quay caused this clerk and the Democratic organization to 
"be advised that as soon as he got around to it, there would "
be a prosecution for stealing a letter from the United States 
mails. It was Quay s genius and force and Dudley s nerve 
that saved the latter. 

"General Harrison carried Indiana by a plurality of 2,300 "
"votes over Mr. Cleveland. The day of the election, No "
"vember 7, Judge Solomon Claypool, a Democrat and the "
special Assistant United States District Attorney who had 
helped prosecute Coy and other Democrats who were still 
"in the penitentiary, discussed Dudley s offense with Judge "
William A. Woods in the latter s chambers. Under Section 
"5511 of the Revised Statutes of 1875, Judge Claypool and "
Judge Woods said Dudley could be indicted and convicted. 

To the Federal Grand Jury that assembled the Mon 
"day following the election, November 13, Judge Woods de "
livered elaborate instructions. As bearing on the Dudley 
"letter, he said: "

"While it is not a crime to attempt the bribery of a voter, it "
is a crime to advise another to make the attempt. If A attempts 
"to bribe B, that is no offense under this statute (5511), but if A "
"advises B to attempt to bribe C, then the one (A) who commends "
or gives this advice is an offender under this law; and I say there 
is some wisdom in this provision. 

"Under section 731, the offense may have its beginning in one "
State and be completed in another. 

"And finally, the man to whom the letter was sent was not guilty. "



THE BLOCKS OF FIVE CASE 607 

"Meanwhile, from the time the mail clerk had turned "
"over the Dudley letter, the Democrats and the Assistant "
"United States Attorney, Leon O. Bailey, had been gather "
"ing evidence of actual bribery. Emory Sellers, the dis "
"trict attorney who had pressed the Coy prosecutions, it is "
"said, hung back from the start. "

The New York World began to gather evidence against 
Dudley as soon as it was sued by him. It showed that vast 
sums of money had been raised and expended in New York. 
"More than 100,000 votes, as it claimed, in New York State "
alone had been purchased by the Republican National 
Committee. 

Better election laws were being demanded all over the 
"land, and especially in Indiana. This was to meet the ob "
"jection that while Dudley s acts were reprehensible, they "
were not criminal in the eyes of the law or the statutes as 
"it or they then stood. And, of course, there was something "
"in this objection, but it could not be advanced by the Re "
"publicans and Judge Woods, who had shoved the pendulum "
to the extreme in prosecuting Democrats. 

"George B. Hastings, a representative of the New York "
"World, came to Chicago to interview Judge Gresham, fol "
"lowed him to Indianapolis, where he was holding court, "
"and on November 26, 1888, sent the following telegram to "
his paper: 

Your correspondent asked Judge Gresham if in his judgment 
the legislature that will convene in January will reform the exist 
"ing election laws, which have brought the State into so much "
disrepute. His answer was prompt and emphatic: 

"There ought to be a reform in our State election system, "
"he said, ""and unless the State takes steps to stop the corruption "
"at the polls, a condition of affairs will be produced to which the "
Rebellion will not be a circumstance. 

It is the Pharisees who are doing this. It is the men of 
prominence and respectability who raise these large sums of 
"money, knowing the use that they will be put to; men who deal "
39



608 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

openly in corruption one day and go to church the next. It is 
these men who bring disgrace upon the State. You may convict 
"a hundred yes, even a thousand obscure voters for bribery, "
but the effect upon the community would be as nothing compared 
"to that which would follow the conviction of one prominent man."" "

But at that Walter 0. Gresham would not use the ju 
diciary for partisan purposes. This will clearly appear at 
the end of the chapter. 

"Editor Holliday was still supporting General Harrison, "
and although the Indianapolis News came out for better 
"election laws, it deprecated Judge Gresham s remarks and "
called on him for his proofs as to the corrupt use of money 
in elections. 

At this time all the large daily newspapers of the land 
had special correspondents at Indianapolis. All were on 
cordial relations with the President-elect. The night of 
"November 24, John T. McCarthy telegraphed his paper, "
"the Cincinnati Enquirer, a dispatch that was printed the "
"next morning in a conspicuous place as a ""special"" from "
New York: 

Will Colonel Dudley be made a scapegoat? There have 
"been various rumors to this effect, and some have even gone so "
far as to claim the famous Dudley letter published during the 
campaign went direct from the Republican State Central Com 
mittee rooms at Indianapolis to the Democratic headquarters. 
"John C. New, never a friend of Dudley s, and ""Nels"" Huston, "
"the Republican chairman, are both incensed at Dudley for inter "
fering in the campaign. 

"Dudley promptly answered from Washington, through "
"the press, that if he was prosecuted he ""would explode a "
"lot of dynamite,"" that he would not be made a scapegoat. "

Then the newspaper men said that General Harrison 
was behind the prosecution in Judge Woods court so far 
"as General Dudley was concerned, and that Dudley would "
be prosecuted to the end by the incoming administration 
and Judge Woods put in the cabinet or in the Supreme 



"THE BLOCKS OF FIVE"" CASE 609 "

Court. The reason given for prosecuting Dudley was 
that General Harrison had not been in sympathy with 
Dudley s methods and wanted to disavow him in the 
most pronounced manner. And one newspaper man con 
"firmed it by publishing an interview with Judge Woods, "
in which the latter avowed his desire to go to the Supreme 
Court. 

Dudley again answered through the press that what he 
"meant by ""exploding a lot of dynamite"" was, that he would "
expose the entire inside workings of the Republican Na 
tional Committee. Then there was a change all along the 
"line. The Indianapolis Journal, John C. New s paper, be "
came Dudley s defender. Every move was then chronicled 
in the press. 

The President-elect had other troubles. To the propo 
"sition to make Mr. Blaine Secretary of State, Editor Holl- "
iday and the other independents who had supported Gen 
"eral Harrison so effectually during the campaign, proved "
implacable. To the suggestion that Mr. Blaine might be 
"the Premier, the Indianapolis News, on December 7, 1888, "
"responded: ""No, .... a corrupt and unsafe man."" "

General Harrison had always belonged to the Blaine 
"wing of the Republican party, and in National conventions "
had voted for Mr. Blaine as a proper man for President. 
"Why, then, should he refrain from saying Mr. Blaine should "
"be Secretary of State After the election, however, power "
ful pressure was exerted to prevent him from doing so. It 
"was so great that no announcement was made, and it was "
not certain that Mr. Blaine would be at the head of the 
State Department until his name actually went to the 
"Senate, when there were outbursts such as that to which "
"Editor Holliday gave way, while the Blaine men claimed "
"they had forced General Harrison to it. And never again, "
"from the day Mr. Blaine entered the State Department, "
was there complete harmony between the Secretary of 
State and the President. 



6io LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

To the proposition to announce ex-Senator Thomas C. 
"Platt as the Secretary of the Treasury, which the Re "
"publican National Committee, with Senator Quay as its "
"chairman, was demanding and Mr. Platt was claiming "
"had been promised to him at Chicago, the independent "
or Mugwump press and Editor Holliday at Indianapolis 
would not assent. Editor Joseph Medill came down from 
"Chicago, on the repeated invitation of the President-elect,"" "
"as he informed the young newspaper men, and told Gen "
eral Harrison it would not do to make Mr. Platt Secre 
"tary of the Treasury. ""Old Joe"" Medill was a great man "
"among the boys. To a ""cub"" reporter who came to inter "
"view him, he said: ""Mr. Driggs, don t you think it pretty "
cheeky for a young newspaper man like you to interview 
"an old newspaper man like me?"" And then he gave the "
young man what he wanted. And as stated in the last 
"chapter, Senator Henry M. Teller of Colorado came and "
threatened to defeat Mr. Platt s confirmation. 

"Instead of taking ""a man from the curb,"" as Benjamin "
"H. Bristow described William H. Windom, who was made "
"Secretary of the Treasury, General Harrison might have "
"fared better had he made Platt Secretary of the Treasury, "
"if Teller had not defeated his confirmation. For the ""Easy "
"Boss"" would have run the ""Street"" as easily as he did the "
"National Convention, and would no doubt have prevented "
Senator Teller from passing the Sherman Silver Act. 

Never after the suggestion to make Mr. Blaine Secretary 
of State did Editor Holliday and his Indianapolis News 
criticize Judge Gresham. 

"December 9, Judge Woods adjourned the Grand Jury for "
one week because he said he must go to Fort Wayne to hold 
court. The newspaper men reported that the next day he 
held court just one hour and forty minutes at Fort Wayne. 

"December 12, Emory Sellers, the United States District "
"Attorney, resigned. At once he was confronted with the "
"charge that he was deserting his post, that he did not resign "



"THE ""BLOCKS OF FIVE CASE 6n "

when Judge Woods drew the indictment in the Coy case. 
From the penitentiary Coy sent out the interview that Sel 
lers was in the conspiracy to prosecute Democrats and pro 
tect Republicans. Sellers answered that he had determined 
"to resign before the election, before the Dudley exposure. "

When Judge Woods adjourned the Grand Jury on the 
"gth, Assistant District Attorney L. O. Bailey had forty "
"Republican county chairmen under subpoena, and most of "
them had then been before the Grand Jury. Mr. Sellers 
"recommended Judge Sullivan, an excellent lawyer on the "
"civil side but without experience in criminal law, as his suc "
"cessor. Instead, President Cleveland sent to the Senate "
"Bailey s name, and reappointed Judge Solomon Claypool as "
special counsel to assist in prosecuting the election cases. 

"The night of December 17, Senator Quay arrived at "
Indianapolis. The next morning John C. New accompanied 
"the Senator to General Harrison s residence, where the Sen "
ator and the President-elect had a two hours conference all 
alone. That afternoon the Senator returned to Washington. 
Immediately following Senator Quay s visit there began 
conferences between Judge Woods and General Harrison s 
"law partner, W. H. H. Miller, and John B. Elam, in which "
General Harrison participated. 

"On the 2oth, the Indianapolis Journal had a scoop from "
Washington that Bailey would not be confirmed as district 
"attorney. The possibility of an indictment for conspiracy, "
"drawn after the model of the Coy indictment, to affect the "
"vote of Indiana, was suggested on the morning of the 2ist "
"by the Democratic organ, the Sentinel, as to why Bailey "
would not be confirmed by a Republican Senate. There was 
no question about Bailey s legal ability and qualifications. 

"Then on the 2ist, the Grand Jury came into court and "
"asked for further instructions. Without giving any reasons, "
"Judge W T oods refused, but said privately: ""If they indict "
"Dudley, they can do so on their own responsibility. Their "
"shoulders are broader than mine."" "



612 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"On December 24, when the Grand Jury adjourned for the "
"holidays, Judge Woods caused it to stand adjourned to "
"January 14, because he would hold court at Evansville the "
first week in January. Thereupon the Indianapolis Jour 
"nal, Mr. New s paper, said the prosecutions had failed and "
that Dudley would not be indicted. The next day the new 
"district attorney, Bailey, in an interview in the Sentinel, "
said he would be very busy during the intervening time 
drafting indictments that had been voted and would be 
signed when the Grand Jury reassembled. 

"January 4, Bailey asked that his name be withdrawn "
from the Senate because Judge Woods had informed him 
"that an indictment, to be valid, must be signed by a district "
attorney who had not only been appointed but also con 
firmed. 

"Under the Federal statutes, to provide for such a con "
tingency as Judge Woods had suggested about there being 
"no district attorney to sign indictments, the justices of the "
Supreme Court were authorized to appoint district attor 
neys ad interim. Promptly on the withdrawal of Bailey s 
"name, ex-Senator McDonald called on Justice Marian, the "
"circuit justice, and requested him to appoint Bailey district "
"attorney ad interim. This Justice Harlan refused to do, "
but was finally prevailed on to appoint Judge Claypool 
"ad interim, and then Mr. Cleveland immediately sent Judge "
"Claypool s name to the Senate, while Bailey continued as "
the assistant. 

Again Dudley renewed his threats. Among the prac 
tical politicians in Indiana he had powerful friends. He 
had narrowly escaped being nominated for governor by the 
"Republicans of Indiana in 1884. These men, in person "
"and by their attorneys, visited the President-elect and the "
"Attorney-General-to-be, William H. H. Miller. Some im "
"portuned, others threatened. "

"One of the latter class was Nathaniel V. Hill, a recipient "
"of one of Dudley s letters, the chairman of the County "



"THE ""BLOCKS OF FIVE"" CASE 613 "

Committee of Monroe County. Afterwards he was elect 
"ed Treasurer of Indiana. He was known as ""Nat"" Hill. "
Right under the shadow of the Indiana State University at 
Bloomington in Monroe County had the electorate been 
corrupted. When rumors were rife that Dudley was to be 
"indicted, if ""Nat"" is to be believed, he called on General "
"Harrison and after saying, ""We can t repudiate Dudley "
"now,"" continued, ""If these prosecutions go on, I will go "
"to the penitentiary at JefTersonville, and you, instead of "
"going to Washington March 4, will be on your way to the "
"Michigan City penitentiary."" "

"January 14, Arthur E. Bateman, Dudley s financial part "
"ner, was closeted two hours with President-elect Harrison. "

"The Grand Jury was about to make a report, having "
"assembled on the i6th of January, pursuant to adjourn "
"ment, when it was called before Judge Woods, who then "
without any request from the jury for enlightenment as to 
"the Dudley scheme, but after elaborating it at length, on "
coming to the gist of the matter said: 

The mere sending by one to another of a letter or a document 
"containing advice to bribe a voter, or setting forth a scheme for "
"such bribery, however bold and reprehensible, is not indictable. "

"Colonel Dudley was not indicted, but indictments were "
"returned against two hundred others, all Republicans. "
"Among them were some of the workers in Monroe County, "
"but ""Nat"" Hill escaped. "

"The next morning, the Indianapolis Sentinel, the Demo "
"cratic organ, in an editorial, said in part: "

The spectacle of a judge deliberately and unblushingly 
prostituting his office to the service of a notorious scoundrel 
"in jeopardy of the law, is a painful and shocking one under "
any form of government and in any stage of civilization. But 
"it is more painful and more shocking in this Republic, perhaps, "
than in any other country on earth ; because in our scheme 
"of government the judiciary occupies a higher position, fills "



614 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"a larger field, is clothed with greater authority, and is re "
garded by the people with more respect and reverence than 
under any other branch of the government. 

"Then, after stating that the indictment of Dudley would "
have led to revelations that could not but leave a cloud 
"on the title of the President-elect, the editorial proceeded: "

As the probability of his indictment developed into a prac 
"tical certainty, the pressure was redoubled, and finally, all other "
"expedients having failed, Judge Woods was induced to call the "
jury before him and tell them that he had misstated the law to 
"them, and that they had no right to indict Dudley unless certain "
things not susceptible of proof could be established. The Sentinel 
is informed and believes that this action was taken after con 
sultation with and upon the importunities of men as close to 
Benjamin Harrison as his recent law partner. 

The occasion is one that calls for the plainest of plain speaking. 
"If the bench fails us, an honest and fearless public press must "
"supply the deficiency, so far as it is in our power. Weighing our "
"words carefully, and fully prepared to accept all the consequences, "
we pronounce the course of Judge Woods in this matter a mon 
"strous abuse of his judicial opportunities, and a flagrant, scandal "
"ous, dishonorable, and utterly unprecedented perversion of the "
machinery of justice to the purposes of knavery. 

"Solomon Claypool, the district attorney, said the second "
"instructions were wrong and the first right, under the rul "
ings of the Supreme Court in the Coy case. Ex-Senator 
"McDonald and John M. Butler, an eminent Republican "
"lawyer, said the first instructions were correct. Partisan "
Democrats were loud in -denouncing the second instructions. 

Judge Woods defended himself by saying he had con 
"sulted Justice Harlan, who had consented, though reluc "
"tantly, to the second instructions. Then the Sentinel at "
tacked Justice Harlan for being partisan. In a case where 
there was such manifest probable cause in view of Justice 
"Marian s course in the Coy case, the editor said that the "
"course of Justice Harlan and Judge Woods would, if "



THE BLOCKS OF FIVE CASE 615 

"pursued, certainly lessen that confidence in the judiciary "
which was essential to its existence. 

"Early in March, Judge Claypool resigned as district at "
"torney, giving as a reason the manifest opposition of Judge "
"Woods to prosecuting the men indicted, while in the Coy "
prosecutions he had been so zealous against the defend 
"ants, Democrats, that lie (Claypool) was forced at times "
privately to request the Judge to restrain his activities 
against them. Judge Claypool s resignation was promptly 
accepted. Smiley N. Chambers was made his successor 
"and John B. Coekrum his assistant, William H. H. Miller "
having become Attorney- General. 

"Mr. Chambers, instead of prosecuting, became an apol "
ogist for General Dudley. He said the Dudley letters had 
"nothing in them of a criminal character, and when so con "
"strued in the light of election practices in Indiana, were "
honorable and indicated simply a patriotic interest in the 
elections. And then Judge Woods began quashing the in 
dictments. There was no pretense that the indictments 
did not charge that a Congressman had been voted for. 
Again Judge Woods was greeted with a storm of criticism. 
Then followed this correspondence with Judge Gresham : 

"DEAR JUDGE: INDIANAPOLIS, March 31, 1889 "

"I desire to make some suggestions and ask you, in your dis "
"cretion, to take some action in respect to pending criminal cases "
in my court here. You doubtless know something of the news 
paper assaults which for some months have been made upon me 
in respect to my Grand Jury charges ; and now that I have quashed 
"the indictments in certain cases, there is a renewal of the attack, "
with such a spirit of malignity and evidently persistent purposes 
"of misrepresentation and abuse of the court, as to justify appre "
"hension that fair trials of the cases remaining to be tried, some "
"of which I suppose to be quite important, can not be had. It is "
"hardly possible that jurors, of whatever political bias or faith, "
"can remain unaffected, one way or the other, by these publica "
"tions. The ruling of the court, which is made the present occasion "



616 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

of criticism if it can be called criticism is in exact accord with 
the ruling of Judges Brewer and Thayer in United States vs. 
"Morrissey, 32 Fed. Rep., and I believe, w r ith your ruling, made "
"about the same time, in the Orange County cases, as they were "
"called a ruling which was in no manner touched, I think, by "
the decisions of Justice Harlan and that of the Supreme Court 
"in the Coy and Bernhamer cases. Now if I am mistaken, I ought "
"to be set right before my ruling is applied to other cases, and "
while it may be connected in the cases where made; arid to this 
end I suggest that you come and pass upon the questions in the 
"Circuit Court, to which some of the cases can be transferred "
"(by agreement at once), or if you think better, send Judge Allen "
of Springfield to sit with me (or alone) both in hearing the motions 
to quash and in trying some of the cases (for bribery) in which 
I have upheld some of the counts of the indictments. The trials 
"are to begin next Wednesday, and it is therefore important that "
"prompt action, whichever way taken, shall be taken by that time "
if practicable. 

I would not have you understand that I doubt the correctness 
"of my own action, or shrink from its consequences, so far as they "
"may be personal to me, but to the end that wicked clamor may "
be hushed and the doing of justice in these cases may remain 
"possible, I have concluded to ask your intervention and accord "
ingly beg your early response. 

"HON. W. Q. GRESHAM, Truly yours. "

CIRCUIT COURT. w _ A ^ WQODS _ 



"HON. WILLIAM A. WOODS, "

"U. S. DISTRICT JUDGE, CHICAGO, April i, 1889. "

"INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA. "
DEAR SIR: 

"I am just in receipt of your letter of yesterday, informing "
me that you have quashed a number of indictments for violation 
of the Federal election laws. You say that your action has 
"provoked severe criticism and abuse, as evidence of which you "
inclose clippings from some of the Indianapolis newspapers. You 
"further say, I would not have you understand that I doubt "



"THE BLOCKS OF FIVE"" CASE 617 "

"the correctness of my own action,"" and ask that I come to Indi "
"anapolis and pass upon the same questions in the Circuit Court, "
"to which some of the cases can be transferred by agreement, or "
"that I send Judge Allen to sit with you, or alone, in the hearing "
of other motions to quash. 

The statutes of the United States authorize the district courts 
"to transfer indictments pending therein to the circuit courts, when "
"in the opinion of the district courts such indictments raise ""diffi "
"cult and important questions of law."" But, in your opinion, these "
indictments raise no such questions. It appears that some of the 
"cases are assigned for trial before you on Wednesday of this week, "
and should you transfer any of them to the Circuit Court it would 
not be possible for me to be at Indianapolis so soon; and in 
"justice to cases before Judge Allen, I could not now order him "
"away from Springfield. Moreover, the cases are regularly in your "
"court; you have already practically commenced trying them, and "
"as you have no doubt of the correctness of your rulings, I see no "
reason why you should not proceed in the ordinary way in the 
discharge of your duty. If a judge is satisfied in his own mind 
"and conscience that he is right, he should not be disturbed by "
anything said or done by others. 

"Yours truly, "

W. O. G RE SHAM. 

"HON. W. Q. GRESHAAI, "

"U. S. CIRCUIT JUDGE, INDIANAPOLIS, April 2, 1889. "

"CHICAGO, ILL. "
DEAR SIR: 

Accepting your letter of the ist inst. as a final declination of 
"the proposition made in mine of the 3ist, I beg to add a word of "
"explanation, as my meaning seems to have been misapprehended. "
"Under Sees. 1037 and 1038, I supposed the responsibility of trans "
ferring an indictment from the District Court to the Circuit Court 
"rested upon the district judge, but as the transfer by the terms "
of the statute remits the case to the next term of the Circuit 
"Court, it was proposed, with your consent and that of attorneys, "
that a hearing should be had in that court at once. You mis 
"take my letter when you say: ""But, in your opinion, these indict "
"ments raise no such questions,"" that is, ""difficult and important "



6i8 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"questions."" I do not ""doubt the correctness of my action."" It is "
"correct action, I suppose, for a judge to decide according to his "
"best belief and judgment, however difficult to reach and however "
"important his conclusion may be. But I will say, "" I do not doubt "
"my conclusion,"" and still it does not follow that in my own mind "
"as well as in fact, the questions are not ""difficult and important."" "
There are only a few of the cases in which any ruling has 
"been made, if that is what you mean by saying I have ""already "
"practically commenced trying them,"" but as it is not convenient "
"for you to come or send another to my assistance, I agree that "
"there is no reason why I should not proceed in the ordinary way, "
"and being assured of my ""own mind and conscience,"" shall en "
"deavor not to be too much ""disturbed by anything said or done "
"by others."" "

"Respectfully, "

W. A. WOODS. 

"Judge Woods went ahead, and not a man was convicted. "
The revelations as to Dudley and the threats as to the dis 
closures he would make if the prosecutions against him were 
"pressed, had discredited General Harrison s administra "
tion before it began. The judiciary was in politics. It was 
attacked in the next Indiana State Democratic platform. 
The people approved. And at the special session of Con 
"gress, called in August, 1893, to repeal the silver bill, the "
Democrats repealed all the legislation providing for United 
States marshals and inspectors at the polls and every sec 
tion of the Enforcement Acts but two which somehow es 
caped their notice.

"SENDS ""SOCKLESS J-ERRY"" SIMPSON TO CONGRESS THE "

CHICAGO AND ATLANTIC CASE. 

"TV /T ARCH 22, 1889, Justice Stanley Matthews of the Su- "
1V-L p reme Court died. In many forms the question arose 

"as put by an old fellow in Kansas, w T ho subsequently "
"became a Populist- ""Will President Harrison put in Mat- "
thews s place the judge who knocked the scaffolding from 
"under Brewer in the Wabash case?"" David J. Brewer had "
been on the Circuit Court of Kansas and was a member of 
the Supreme Court of that State when he was appointed 
United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit. 

There were many requests made to President Harrison 
to name Judge Gresham as Justice Matthews s successor. 
But uniformly and positively Judge Gresham requested 
that all efforts on this line be abstained from. He asked 
Joseph Medill to stop a demand he had started in his paper 
"for Gresham s appointment, and Mr. Medill respected his "
wishes. To General Benjamin H. Bristow s written request 
as to whether he should call on President Harrison and 
"request Gresham s appointment to the existing vacancy, "
"Gresham promptly answered, ""Most certainly not."" Then "
"Bristow replied: ""Notwithstanding your wishes, in order "

620 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

that the President can not say that no one ever asked him 
"to appoint you, I am going to Washington and make the "
"request."" Subsequently he wrote that he had done so. "
Men like Judge Cooley and lawyers from all over the land 
wrote that they had written the President suggesting the 
appointment of Judge Gresham to the Supreme Bench. 
"Newspapers advocated it, according to press notices. But "
my husband s attitude toward the Dudley prosecutions 
"make it plain that he was not ""trimming his sails"" for the "
Supreme Court. Albert J. Beveridge was one of the men 
opposed to Walter Q. Gresham s accepting the appoint 
"ment, if tendered. By refusing to make the appointment "
President Harrison did not displease everybody. 

"Already the nebulae of the ""Populist"" party many of "
"whose tenets, revolutionary at the time, have since been "
written into the organic law of the land had appeared 
"in the Western horizon. In November, 1888. the ""Union "
"Labor"" party of Cowley County, Kansas, had elected "
the sheriff of that county. Men were recurring to the 
"protest of the June before of B. F. Osborne, chairman of "
"the Kansas delegation, against making a railroad attorney "
"the temporary chairman of the party of ""freedom and "
"progress."" 1 "

"Senator John Sherman s Anti-Trust Bill, to carry out "
the anti-trust plank of the Republican platform of the 
"June before, introduced into Congress December 9. i888, 2 "
"met with a cold reception, and this, too, notwithstanding "
the discussions both public and private that followed the 
"explosion of dynamite on December 10, 1888, in the Shu- "
feldt Distillery at Larrabee Street and Chicago Avenue in 
the city of Chicago. 3 

"The owners of this establishment, H. H. Shufeldt and "
"Thomas Lynch, under the firm name of H. H. Shufeldt "
"Co., had rejected all the efforts of the ""trust"" to buy them "
"out. Their attorney, Edwin Walker, and Mrs.. Walker were "
among our intimate friends. Edwin Walker was one of the 

!See page 584. 2 See page 632. 3 See page 639. 



THE WABASH CASE AGAIN 621 

eminent lawyers of his time. He afterwards steered the 
"World s Columbian Exposition Company, the corporation "
"that so successfully conducted the ""World s Fair."" In this "
Walter Q. Gresham was one of his confidential advisers. 
Mr. Walker helped prosecute Debs. He was a Republican 
"in politics and a strong protectionist, but he voted for "
Grover Cleveland in 1892. Mrs. Walker was from an old 
Democratic family and clung to her father s views. Ac 
"complished, and one of the best housekeepers I ever knew, "
"Mrs. Walker possessed a knowledge of economics, business, "
"and politics, that surpassed that of many of the politicians "
or statesmen of her day. 

Efforts had been made and continued to be made to 
minimize the force of the Wabash judgment and weaken 
and discredit the judge who made it. The Wabash opin 
ion stood only for honest management of corporate prop 
erty. There were railroad attorneys who wanted to be for 
Gresham in 1888. Church Howe was one of them. 

"December 9, 1889, President Harrison sent to the Senate "
the name of David J. Brewer as the successor of Justice 
"Stanley Matthews, and thirty days later the appointment "
"was confirmed. Able and learned, with his social side well "
"developed, popular with bench and bar, Judge Brewer s "
"appointment was looked on, especially west of the Missis "
"sippi, whence he came, as part of the plan to preserve, "
"through the judiciary, the undue influence the special in "
"terests exerted in the government, as well as rebuke a judge "
"who stood for the equal enforcement of the law."" View "
"it as we may, the fact is that some of Judge Brewer s first "
judicial opinions confirmed this impression. 

We must recur to the receiverships on the Illinois 
Midland Railroad. 1 Judge Harlan handled that case 
while Judge Gresham was running the receivership on 
"the ""Narrow Gauge."" The decree in appeals which went "
to the Supreme Court from Justice Harlan s decree in the 
Circuit Court in the Illinois Midland case especially in 

1 See pages 507-8. 



622 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"all that applied to paying the ""Tin Bucket Brigade,"" "
"where there was a greater displacement of ""vested under "
"lying liens"" than in any case that had up to this time been "
"passed on by the Supreme Court was affirmed, while the "
"decrees in the appeals in the ""Narrow Gauge"" case were "
reversed. The questions were the same but the decisions 
were different. 

"As we have seen, the appeals in the Midland case were "
"advanced, submitted on brief January 12, 1886, and decided "
"April 15, 1886. The appeals in the Narrow Gauge case "
went to the Supreme Court contemporaneously with those 
"in the Illinois Midland case, but they took the regular "
order. They were not decided until the Spring of 1890. 
The Narrow Gauge case was in part heard by Circuit 
"Judge Jackson of the Sixth Circuit, Circuit Judge Gresham "
"of the Seventh, and District Judge Sage of Cincinnati. "

"March 17, 1890, the Supreme Court in Railroad Com "
"pany vs. Hamilton (134 U. S. 296), the first of the Narrow "
"Gauge cases to be reached, reversed Judge Jackson s decree- "
in which he put ahead of the first mortgage the claim for a 
mechanic s lien for constructing a dock at the terminals of 
the Narrow Gauge system in Toledo. Justice Brewer de 
livered the opinion of the Supreme Court. 

"According to the precedents, there was less reason for "
Judge Jackson allowing this claim than there was for 
Judge Gresham allowing the claim of the Grant Locomo 
"tive Works, in Kneeland vs. Grant Locomotive Works (136 "
"U. S. 79), decided May 19, 1890, for the use of engines dur "
ing the four months of a receivership under a judgment 
creditors bill immediately preceding the receivership insti 
tuted by the bondholders. 

"Indeed, every precedent and every expression of the "
Supreme Court prior to this time justified the decree Judge 
"Gresham entered, and yet Judge Jackson was reversed in "
"becoming judicial language, while Judge Gresham w r as "
reversed with a rebuke. If it was necessary to reverse 



THE W A BASH CASE AGAIN 623 

"the practice that had long obtained, the rebuke should "
have been administered at the first opportunity. 

"This was the Narrow Gauge case. July i, 1883, Judge "
"Drummond, at the instance of a judgment creditor or on "
"a bill filed by a judgment creditor, appointed George D. "
Branham receiver of the Narrow Gauge system of railroads. 
The bondholders did not object. They stood by until 
"November i, 1883, when they asked that they be given "
the receivership and their mortgage foreclosed. That day 
they were given the receivership. In due time their mort 
"gage was foreclosed, under a decree which practically gave "
"them possession of the road without a sale, conditioned only "
that they pay such claims as the court might decree to 
be in equity prior to the lien of their mortgage. 

"When Branham took possession, he found in the pos "
session of the railroad company certain locomotives belong 
ing to the Grant Locomotive Works. These locomotives 
were held under leases between the Grant Locomotive 
"Works and the Toledo, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Railroad "
"Company, or the ""Narrow Gauge Company,"" with the "
right to the railroad company to purchase them at any time 
"at a certain price, and with a further provision that when "
the monthly payment of the rent aggregated the agreed 
"purchase price, the title should pass to the railroad, com "
pany. From the start the receivers held on to these loco 
"motives, as without them the road could not have been "
"operated. The rolling "" stock people demanded the rental "
"as stipulated, even prior to the receivership, under the "
"judgment creditor s bill, then during that receivership and "
the receivership at the instance of the bondholders. The 
bondholders said there should not only be no allowance for 
the period prior to the receivership under the judgment 
"creditor, but that no rental should be paid during the "
receivership of the judgment creditor. 

Judge Gresham rejected all claims for rent prior to 
"the receivership instituted on July i, 1883. For the four "
40



624 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

months during the receivership under the judgment credi 
"tors bill, that is, before the bondholders actively inter "
"vened, Judge Gresham rejected the claim for rent under "
"the leases, but allowed the rolling stock people compen "
sation for the use of their engines on the basis of about 
"one-third of what was provided for in the lease; that is, on "
a quantum meruit basis. 

"Now for the rebuke. In order to justify the reversal, "
Judge Brewer had to go back to Judge Drummond s dis 
carded language in the Chicago &amp; Alton case of 1864.* 
We quote him: 

One holding a mortgage debt upon a railroad has the same right 
to demand and expect of the court respect for his vested and con 
tracted priority as the holder of a mortgage on a farm or lot. 

"Indeed, we are advised that some courts have made the "
appointment of a receiver conditioned upon the payment of all 
unsecured indebtedness in preference to the mortgage liens sought 
to be enforced. Can anything be conceived which more thor 
oughly destroys the sacredness of contract obligations? 

That other than legal and equitable considerations en 
tered into this judgment of the Supreme Court is mani 
"fest when we consider that five years later, in an exactly "
similar case Louisville Loan &amp; Trust Company vs. Louis 
"ville, New Albany &amp; Chicago Railway Company (174 U. S. "
"674) the Supreme Court reversed itself, the Court of "
"Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and Judge Woods, who "
had literally followed Kneeland vs. Loan &amp; Trust Company 
(136 U. S. 97). Again Justice Brewer was the mouthpiece 
of the court. To justify his conclusion and that of the 
"court, the major premise that of Judge Drummond in "
"Turner vs. Indianapolis, Bloomington &amp; Western Railway "
"(Bissell) of 1879, was adopted, namely, ""Then a mortgage "
"on a railroad is not like an ordinary mortgage on land""- "

"The rebuke at once attracted wide attention, and much "
resentment. From Maine to California came letters from 
members of the bar. The explanation vouched privately 

!See page 372. 2 See pages 376-7. 



THE WABASH CASE AGAIN 625 

by members of the Supreme Court was that the rebuke was 
"intended for Judge Caldwcll of the Eighth Circuit, Judge "
Brewer s successor. 

"Judge Caldwell in the Eighth Circuit, as a condition "
"precedent to appointing a receiver, had required the bond "
holders to pay claims for personal injuries and other like 
claims which in no wise w r ere betterments to the property. 
"As he put it to one attorney, If you want rric to open the "
"door, you must come to my terms,"" a summing up in a "
sentence of a score of the decisions of the Supreme Court 
"; The appointment of a receiver was not a matter of right."" "
"It was Judge Caldwell s view that, in extending the protect "
"ing arm of the court, with all the power of the nation "
"behind it, because of the public interests involved, the court "
making the appointment could impose terms largely within 
the discretion of the judge to whom the application was 
made. He had gone farther than Judge Gresham ever fol 
"lowed Judge Drummond, who inaugurated the system; and "
ultimately Judge Caldwell seems to have had the sanction 
"of the Supreme Court, as appears from the opinions of "
Justices Brewer and Harlan we have last cited. In other 
"words, that eminent tribunal, as Mr. Lincoln once said in "
"refusing to accept its rulings as final, especially in matters "
"that affect the entire public, has often reversed itself. "

Judge Caldwell did not accept the privately expressed 
views of the Supreme judges that the rebuke in the Knee- 
"land case was aimed at him. On the contrary, apparently "
"with design, he spread the report in the Eighth Circuit "
that the rebuke was intended for Gresham. In the con 
"fidence of his chambers, Judge Caldwell was deft in poison "
ing the minds of many an attorney against the members 
of the Supreme Court. : They will never stand for that 
"Wabash case,"" w r as one of Judge Caldwell s expressions. "
"And yet, as we have shown, Judge Gresham s judgment in "
the Wabash case had been confirmed by several acts of 
Congress. 



626 LIFE OF WALTER QUINT IN GRESHAM 

"If it was not aimed at Gresham, the opinion should "
"have been so framed as to exclude that impression, and "
should have been written by some other member of the 
"court than Justice Brewer, especially as Justice Brewer "
"was a nephew of Cyrus W. Field, one of the financiers "
whose conduct had been under review in the Wabash case. 
Even though it be as General Swayne said in a letter to 
"Judge Gresham, ""Mr. Field got from under before the "
"trouble came,"" the fact is, the impression went broadcast, "
"especially throughout the Eighth Circuit, embracing the "
"States of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, "
"the Dakotas, Wyoming, and Colorado, that the Supreme "
"Court was ""dressing Gresham down."" And there were "
men lawyers high and low who resented it. And \vhen 
"it comes to digging into the web and woof of things, one "
lawyer is the superior of dozens of politicians. 

In 1889 the information came that the Harrison admin 
"istration, through its Department of Justice, was searching "
"the records to get something on Judge Gresham. ""Afraid "
"of nothing but sin,"" as Henry Watterson put it, Judge "
"Gresham never ceased ""Wabashing"" railroad property, when "
it came his way. But notwithstanding the feeling and the 
sentiments that Walter O. Gresham knew T the members of 
"the Harrison administration, including President Harrison "
"himself, entertained and manifested toward him, the record "
is conclusive that in Judge Gresham s court it fare.d better 
"than at the hands of any other Federal judge, even judges "
that it created. 

"Meantime, on September 21, 1889, the People s party "
"was formally born. That day, at Winfield, Kansas, four "
"rural leaders, Mike Markham, Bill Grow, Sam Strong, and "
"Dick Chase, walked out of the Cowley County Republican "
"Convention. They consulted Judge A. J. Miller, and in "
side of a week they and their followers in the Republican 
"party, under the name of the People s party, were joined "
by the Democrats and the Cowley County Union Labor 



THE WABASH CASE AGAIN 627 

"party, then less than a year old. The American Non- "
"Conformist, a newspaper that had made much of the Wabash "
"decision, became an advocate of the platform of the new "
party. The Non-Conformist was ably and fearlessly edited 
by Mr. James Vincent and his son Henry. James was an 
English Abolitionist. After helping in the clean-up of the 
"British Empire, he moved to America in 1848 and settled "
"in Iowa, thence to Kansas to continue his war against the "
"divine institution. At Tabor, Iowa, John Brown had "
"a station in James Vincent s house. Meantime, the Vin "
"cents became correspondents of Walter Q. Gresham, w r ho "
"made no secret of his views of ""men and measures."" "

"In November, 1889, the newly founded People s party "
carried Cowley County by a good majority. The fast- 
"growing ""Farmers Alliance"" joined the new movement, "
and in 1890 the State that had hitherto been overwhelm 
"ingly Republican voted the People s party ticket by 80,000. "
Out of one hundred and twenty-six members of the State 
"legislature the ""Populists"" elected ninety-four. Thomas "
"Benton Carr of Medicine Lodge, Kansas, but bred to the "
law in southern Indiana while Walter Q. Gresham was at 
"the bar, was unsurpassed as an agitator. He was the "
"brains of ""Sockless Jerry Simpson of Medicine Lodge,"" "
who in 1890 was elected to Congress by an overwhelming 
majority over his Republican opponent. 

Another story Judge Caldwell told was that even Justice 
Harlan was influenced by Justice Brewer. But we have 
shown that the want of cordiality between Justice Harlan 
and Judge Gresham grew out of the Angle case. At first 
"Justice Harlan approved the Wabash ruling, although it "
was opposed to his idea of central control. 

"In the Northern Pacific receivership, when Judge Han- "
"ford, the district judge in the State of Washington, with "
"the Wabash ruling as a precedent, raised some questions as "
"to the propriety of certain orders which Judge Jenkins, who "
"had appointed the receivers at Milwaukee, \vas entering, "



628 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"Judge Caldwell said to the attorneys, eminent in their line, "
"who were conducting the case, ""If you can get Judge "
Harlan to intervene you can get a modification of that 
"Wabash case."" At first Justice Harlan, so the attorneys "
"said, refused to have anything to do with the matter. "
Finally he did so at Washington. Armed with a letter 
"from Justice Harlan, the attorneys went to Seattle, and with "
"that letter and good dinners, Judge Hanford was prevailed "
on to abandon his efforts to run the Pacific end of the 
Northern Pacific receiverships; and the good dinners and 
"goodfellowship, one of the counsel engaged said he believed "
were more potent than Justice Harlan s letter. Subse 
quently Judge Hanford resigned in the face of impeach 
ment proceedings. 

Further complications arising in the Northern Pacific 
"receivership because of the Wabash precedent, a case was "
"made up for four of the Supreme Court justices Field, "
"Harlan, Brewer, and Brown to pass on the circuit. The "
"hearing was had, but there was not that modification of the "
Wabash ruling that was hoped for and desired. 1 

There are many things that even unanimous consent 
of counsel and parties is insufficient to authorize a judge 
"to do. May 18, 1889, Walter Q. Gresham, on his own mo "
"tion, appointed Volney T. Malott receiver of the Chicago "
&amp; Atlantic Railroad Company. Another a railroad man 
"-had previously been decided on by counsel and parties, "
"including J. Pierpont Morgan &amp; Co., for this receivership. "

This Chicago &amp; Atlantic case we have adverted to before 
because it dovetailed into the Wabash case. 2 The Chicago 
"&amp; Atlantic Company had built, in the interests of the Erie "
"Company, the railroad from Marion, Ohio, to Chicago, "
"270 miles, as the western extension of the Erie. But the "
money to build it had been furnished by citizens of Holland 
on the guaranty of the Erie Company that the Chicago &amp; 

"1 Farmers Loan &amp; Trust Company rs. The Northern Pacific Railroad Company, "
72 Fed. Rep. 26. 
2 See page 551- 



THE WABASH CASE AGAIN 629 

Atlantic Company would promptly pay the interest on this 
loan. For the first eighteen months after the road was 
"opened for traffic in 1883, failing to earn operating expenses "
"and interest, the Erie Company advanced the interest; "
"then dissensions arose, and the Erie Company refused long "
er to advance the interest said its contract of guaranty 
was ultra vires. It then caused a bill to be filed for the 
appointment of a receiver for the Chicago &amp; Atlantic 
"Company, and asked for a foreclosure of the mortgage on "
account of the interest it had paid. 

"At first the Holland bondholders, by Alexander &amp; Green, "
opposed the appointment of a receiver. They were then 
opposing the Erie Company s attempt to get possession of 
the railroad. They represented to the court that the Chi 
cago &amp; Atlantic Railroad was in splendid physical condition ; 
that they had advanced their money on the faith of the 
promise of the Erie Company that it would pay their inter 
"est ; and rather than that the Erie Company, having default "
"ed in its promise, should get possession of their property, "
"they were willing to defer their interest. Meanwhile, they "
"said, let the Chicago &amp; Atlantic Company continue to oper "
ate the road. Ever considerate of the wishes of the real 
"owners of property, Judge Gresham refused, on this show "
"ing, to appoint a receiver when the Erie Company was the "
"moving party. Three years later, after a decree of fore "
closure in which the validity of the Hollanders mortgage 
"had been upheld, pending an appeal to the Supreme Court "
in which the validity of the Hollanders mortgage was still 
"questioned, and after the Hollanders and the Erie Company "
had settled their differences and united in a motion for a re 
"ceiver, Mr. Malott was appointed. Mr. Malott was a prac "
tical railroad man of long experience. Judge Ho well E. 
Jackson of the Sixth Circuit promptly confirmed the Mal 
ott appointment as to that part of the road in Ohio that 
was within his jurisdiction. Suspecting that perhaps the 
road had not been maintained as it should have been in 



630 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"the interim, Judge Gresham instructed Mr. Malott, imme "
"diately on his appointment, to look to the physical condition "
"of the road, and meanwhile take all temporary precautions "
against accidents that might result in injury to employees 
and the traveling public. 

Within thirty days Mr. Malott presented a written re 
port to Judge Gresham in which he set forth that the Chi 
cago &amp; Atlantic Railroad was in a dilapidated condition - 
"rails, ties, fish-plates, angle-bars, and bridges. A piece of "
a rotten bridge timber was brought along as an exhibit. 

Chief Justice Fuller was then in Chicago. Judge Jackson 
"was written to, and asked to come to Chicago and sit, with "
the Chief Justice and Judge Gresham and consider this 
report. 

The report was considered in chambers by the three 
judges and the receiver without any one else present. Mr. 
Malott was asked how much it would take to make the 
"road safe for the operation of trains. His answer was, "
"$350,000. Accordingly, with the approval of his as "
"sociates, Judge Gresham, on June 20, drafted an order "
"that the receiver be authorized to borrow $350,000 and se "
cure its payment by receiver s certificates that should be 
"a lien on the road superior to the lien of the mortgages, and "
unless the bondholders and the Erie Company consented 
"to the issuance of these receiver s certificates, that on or "
"before August i, 1889, the operation of trains over the "
road should be abandoned. Mr. Malott had stated he 
could readily get the money. He at that time was presi 
dent of one of the best National banks in the country. 

"Accordingly Receiver Malott and Edward Daniels, his "
"counsel, proceeded to New York and assembled J. Pierpont "
"Morgan, whose firm was reorganizing the Chicago &amp; At "
lantic Company and was then the fiscal agent of the Erie 
"Company, Turner, Lee, &amp; McClure, attorneys for the "
"Farmers Loan &amp; Trust Company, and the trustees in "
the first and second mortgages of the Chicago &amp; Atlantic 



THE W ABASH CASE AGAIN 631 

"Company; Alexander &amp; Green, the counsel of the first "
mortgage bondholders or the Hollanders; Charles W. Fair 
"banks, representing George J. Bippus, one of the trustees "
"of the second mortgage; John King, the president, and Ben "
"jamin H. Bristow, the counsel of the Erie Company. To "
the assembly Mr. Malott exhibited and explained the order 
"of the court. All were surprised, but none except J. Pier- "
pont Morgan showed resentment. Through Justice Field 
"of the Supreme Court, the few second mortgage bondholders, "
who were prosecuting the appeal to the Supreme Court in 
"which the validity of the first mortgage was questioned, "
had been prevailed on to come into Mr. Morgan s plan of 
reorganization and to dismiss their appeal. C. W. Fair 
"banks, the counsel for these appealing bondholders, was "
very indignant at Justice Field for ending his lawsuit. But 
"Mr. Morgan was the most indignant of all, for the order of "
"June 20, 1889, upset all his plans for the reorganization of "
"the Chicago Atlantic Company. He said, ""The money "
cannot be raised on receiver s certificates. I will discredit 
"them everywhere."" Mr. Malott said, ""Gentlemen, I do "
"not ask you to raise the money. I will attend to that."" "
The consent was given. 

As there had been no diversion of earnings from operat 
"ing expenses, there was a reasonable doubt if the Supreme "
Court would have sustained the issuance of the certificates 
in this case without the consent of the bondholders. But 
to mandate a circuit judge to operate a railroad while un 
"safe to the employees and traveling public, was going farther "
than it was believed it would then have gone. 

Mr. Malott so increased the business of the Chicago &amp; 
Atlantic Railroad for he was a practical railroad man 
as well as a banker that out of the earnings of the road 
he was able to make it safe and did not have to sell a single 
one of the authorized certificates.

TRUST FAILED - THE SUGAR TRUST CASE OTHER PROSE 
CUTIONS. 



Republican members of the Congress that assembled 
"in December, 1889, selected Thomas B. Reed Speak "
er over William McKinley. Speaker Reed appointed Mr. 
"McKinley Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, "
and hence the tariff act that passed that Congress received 
"the name ""McKinley Bill."" "

But long before the McKinley Bill had even passed the 
"House, Senator Sherman had put his Anti-Trust Act of "
"July 2, 1890, through both Houses. When he signed it, "
"President Harrison remarked: ""John Sherman has fixed "
"General Alger."" The allusion was to Frank Hatton s "
complaint that General Alger had purchased certain dele 
gates in the Chicago convention of the year before. 

"Walter Q. Gresham never believed that John Sherman, "
"in his public conduct, was influenced by his passions or "
"his resentments. But whatever the motive, Senator Sher "
man 1 was prompt to act. In the Congress that assembled in 
"December, 1888, he introduced his bill, as he said, to carry "
out the an ti -trust plank of the Republican platform of that 
year. 

"A lawsuit at Detroit, David M. Richardson vs. Russell "
"A. Alger and Christian A. Buhl, disclosed whence came the "
lavish expenditures that General Alger had made as a Presi 
dential candidate. In justifying the increase of the capital

"account of the Diamond Match Trust, General Alger tes "
"tified that during the years 1881 and 1882, to keep men out "
"of the match business, large sums were expended in buying "
machinery and patents and match factories which were dis 
mantled. The money thus expended enabled the trust to 
keep up prices and pay large dividends. The decision of 
"the lower court, the Circuit Court of Wayne County, Michi "
"gan, on the chancery side was satisfactory to neither party, "
and both wanted the controversy decided by the Supreme 
"Court of Michigan. But that court (77 Mich. 271), invoking "
"the rule that ""a court of conscience would not countenance "
"an immoral contract"" ""a contract in furtherance of a "
"scheme to restrain trade"" - of its own motion ""turned both "
"parties out of court"" without deciding the controversy. "
And then as a warning to the legislative and executive 
"branches of the government, State and National, it said if "
such combinations as the Diamond Match Trust were al 
"lowed to exist, it w r ould not be long until they overwhelmed "
all popular government. 

"Michigan lawyers, Grand Army men, among whom Gen "
"eral Alger w r as prominent, were frequent visitors while we "
"lived at the Palmer House, and at our Prairie Avenue home, "
"in Chicago. Some were friends of General Alger, some not. "
Some repeated in private what Joseph Medill had said in his 
paper about General Alger. It was from one of these that 
Senator Sherman got his specific information about the case 
"of Richardson vs. Alger. It was November 15, 1889, that "
"the Michigan Supreme Court handed down its decision, or "
"more properly, its philippic. Senator Sherman followed it "
up by reintroducing his Anti-Trust act when Congress met 
"December 6, 1889. The attorneys for the trust were there "
"to draw, as they did, the match schedule in the McKinley "
"Act, and later also in the Dingley Bill. 1 "

"Having had trouble in New York, the Diamond Match "

"lAt the time of the Dingley Bill, Edwin Walker had become the attorney of the Diamond "
"Match Company, and he it was who wrote the match schedule of the Act. "



634 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"Trust organized February 13, 1889, as a corporation under "
the laws of Illinois. One of our neighbors was making 
enormous amounts of money out of the Diamond Match 
Company of Illinois. It w r as a small organization com 
"pared to the Standard Oil and the Sugar Trusts, but it was "
a lusty infant. Our friend urged me to buy some of the 
"Diamond Match stock. ""It is now a corporation and has "
"a recognized legal status."" The absurdity of the proposi "
tion that a State could grant a charter to a corporation to 
"do what the State itself could not do, namely, regulate trade "
and commerce between the States or nullify or defeat an act 
"of Congress, was pointed out by my husband so clearly and "
"vehemently that even a woman, educated as I had been, "
"in the field, who had seen ""the war legislate,"" and had "
"heard lawyers and judges talk for years, could see the point. "
And yet eminent lawyers and the most of the American bar 
said that when the Standard Oil Trust organized as a cor 
"poration under the laws of the State of New Jersey, it was "
immune from attack by the National government. 

The Diamond Match Company possessed patents that 
made it a monopoly without the aid of any tariff. 

What little money my Irish uncle had left me I kept in real 
estate. Once I did lose a few hundred dollars on the Board 
"of Trade, and the broker said I was a good loser. He and I "
"alone knew of the transaction, which was buying wheat on "
"margin. Women speculate, but it is on the long side. A "
"woman never sells ""short,""- - that is, she doesn t figure prices "
are going down. For a public man in Washington to say 
he did not know and would not know how to operate or 
speculate on the stock or grain market removes the last 
doubt that I have as to my right and duty to tell my story. 
Because men will gamble in the guise of buying and selling 
"for future delivery is no reason for abolishing the latter, "
or the boards of trade and public marts through which it is 
"conducted. Every person who plants a crop is a speculator, "
but not a gambler. 



SHERMAN ACT AND M C K I N L E Y BILL 635 

"Men and women, rich and poor, black and white, eame to "
"Walter Q. Gresham for counsel and advice. ""Old Hutch"" "
"(B. P. Hutchinson), one of the great Board of Trade specu "
"lators or gamblers, if you please, was a native of Lynn, "
Massachusetts. He was one of the early pork packers of 
Chicago and almost always a money-maker. He carried 
big bank balances. It was not to get credit but to help his 
friends that he organized the Corn Exchange National 
Bank. When it was put up to him that he must sign as 
"president every note the bank issued, he said, ""I have no "
"time for that,"" and resigned. Many hours have I listened "
to B. P. Hutchinson and Mr. Gresham talking. Carrying 
"a big load or ""line,"" stimulants failing to relieve the ten "
"sion, the old man would seek my husband. Sometimes he "
would indicate he did not want me present. Then I would 
retire. The information that Judge Gresham acquired 
from such an encyclopedia of statistics and facts as was 
Old Hutch was large. Sympathy and good advice 
"helped to restrain ""Old Hutch s"" gambling propensities, "
and he died a rich man. 

Sometimes brokers would send checks to my husband 
and say it was his share of a certain speculation in stocks 
that a certain gentleman or gentlemen had carried on for 
his account. Promptly the checks would be returned with 
"the statement: ""The venture was not authorized by me; "
neither my money nor my credit entered into the purchase 
"and I can accept none of the proceeds."" "

"The Sherman Anti-Trust Bill, as originally introduced "
"in December, 1888, and as reintroduced in December, 1889, "
"provided that any person, firm, or corporation receiving "
"any benefit under any tariff law, that became a party to "
any combination to forestall or stifle competition as pro 
"hibited by any State statute or the Sherman Act, would "
be subject to the pains and penalties of the Sherman Law. 
From the foundation of the government the argument in 
favor of a high tariff had been that the manufacturers 



636 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

would compete amongst themselves and thus lower prices. 
"But instead of doing this, inside the Chinese wall the war "
"legislation had constructed, they were combining in the "
form of trusts to keep up prices. 

Senator Sherman well understood the confines of State 
and Federal jurisdiction. Why could not Congress pass a 
law that would prevent the perversion of the benefits con 
ferred on a manufacturer by a fostering law of Congress? 
Walter 0. Gresham believed with Senator Sherman that it 
could constitutionally do so. 

The tariff barons and their lawyers said such legisla 
tion would be unconstitutional. Congress has no power to 
interfere with manufacturing per se. Certainly not. But 
"if the manufacturer comes to Congress for protection, Con "
gress should see that that manufacturer does not abuse 
that protection. According to Judge Gresham s way of 
"thinking, any perversion of the benefits derived under a "
Federal statute would present a Federal question because 
it would be a controversy arising under the laws of the 
"United States, and therefore the Federal courts would have "
jurisdiction. But the best way to restrain the combines 
was to limit the customs duties so that the trust could 
"not, because of foreign competition, become so great as to "
be a menace to the government and to society. 

The theory prevailed that Air. Sherman s draft of the 
"bill was unconstitutional, so Senators Hoar and Edmunds "
"of the Judiciary Committee, it is said, rewrote the bill under "
"the commerce clause of the Constitution, clearly covering "
by its terms a trust or combination incorporated under the 
"laws of the States; as, for instance, the Diamond Match "
Company of Illinois. 

Without the actual experience in the courtroom as law 
"yers that Senators Edmunds and Hoar possessed, Senator "
Sherman was the superior of both and of all others of that 
time in long service and in practical administrative and 
"legislative experience. He could see through a millstone, if "



SHERMAN ACT AND MCKINLEY BILL 637 

there was a hole in it. He promptly aeeepted the amended 
bill and drove it through Congress. It was not an admin 
"istrative measure, it was not a party measure. The trusts, "
"the combines, and the men who were rewriting the sched "
"ules of the McKinley Bill, did not want it. "

Senator Hoar said the amended bill did not prohibit 
reasonable restraint of trade. After it was found that it 
did and some men of practical experience say there is 
"no such thing as ""reasonable restraint of trade"" several "
attempts were made to induce Congress to amend the act 
"by writing in it the word ""reasonable."" It was to get from "
"under the doctrine of ""reasonable restraint of trade"" that "
led the American colonists to break with the British king. 
Reasonable restraint of trade is a common law doctrine 
pure and simple. There is no common law of the United 
"States. 1 Failing to induce Congress to amend the act, the "
Supreme Court of the United States in the Standard Oil 
"case was led to interpret the act as if the word ""reasonable"" "
"was in it, although Justice Harlan in a dissenting opinion "
warned them it was legislation pure and simple. 2 And yet 
people marvel that the proposition of the judicial recall 
has been advanced. One of William H. Taft s mistakes 
as President was to defend the opinion of the court in the 
"Standard Oil case. But as a judge he was among the first, "
"if not the first, to interpret the act as it was written. "

"But coming back to the McKinley Bill, to which the "
Sherman Act was such an undesirable supplement. The 
former did not get through the House of Representatives 
until late in the Summer of 1890. With it there went to 
"the Senate a ""Force Bill."" This Force Bill was an ad "
"ministration, President Harrison s, measure designed to "
secure the ballot to the negro in the South. But the prac 
"tical men in the Republican party, led by Senator Quay, "
"were not behind it, and its fate shows that General Harri "
son s fears as a candidate that he would not have much 

"iWheton vs. Peters, 8 Peters 59L P. 653. 2 221 U. S. 91, 105. "



638 LIFE OF WALTER QUINT IN ORE SHAM 

influence at Washington as President were well grounded. 
The Senate was Republican by a scant majority. In order 
"to defeat the Force Bill, the Southern senators threat "
ened to filibuster to the end of the session before they 
"would let any legislation pass. To meet this situation, Sena "
tor Quay agreed with Senator Vest of Missouri that if the 
"Democrats would allow a vote on the McKinley Bill, Quay "
would cause enough Republican votes to be cast against 
the Force Bill to defeat it. 1 The Force Bill was defeated. 
"And then before the vote on the McKinley Bill, Senator "
"Wolcott of Colorado, with Senator Teller steering him, "
served notice that the silver interests of Colorado were 
entitled to as much consideration as the iron interests of 
"Pennsylvania, and unless provisions were made for the "
"former, the Senators from Colorado and the other silver "
States would vote against the McKinley Bill. 

"Promptly John Sherman s Silver Bill, to coin 6,000,000 "
ounces .of silver bullion into dollars at the ratio of 16 to i 
"of gold, while the commercial ratio was almost 32 to i, was "
passed with the McKinley Bill. Its practical operation 
satisfied neither the silver nor the sound money men. To 
"the latter class President Harrison belonged. And yet, "
when the inevitable effect was presented to him of issu 
ing bonds to buy gold to protect the gold reserve in the 
"Treasury, he refused. A subsequent chapter will show how "
"President Cleveland met the emergency after V. T, Malott, "
"the Indianapolis banker, pointed out the way. "

When President Harrison signed the McKinley Bill on 
"October 9, 1890, he stated to Major McKinley, This "
"defeats us."" Soon after, at a dinner in honor of General "
Miles s assuming command of the Department of the 
"Lakes, Walter Q. Gresham declared the McKinley Bill a "
departure from the policy of Henry Clay. 

"Major McKinley, in the November election of 1890, was "
himself in his ow r n congressional district overwhelmingly 
"defeated, and his party with him. We have shown in the "

1 See page 812 



SHERMAN ACT AND MCKINLEY BILL 639 

"preceding chapter how, on the judicial side, there were contri "
"buting causes. Kansas, Nebraska, and other Western States "
were carried by the Populist party by immense majorities. 

"Lawyer that he was, and a good one, President Harrison "
was lacking in executive ability and leadership. When it 
"came to legislation, he was entirely ignored. Speaking by "
"the record, the Harrison administration was not fortunate "
"in its efforts to enforce, or in laying the foundation for the "
enforcement of the Sherman Act. 

After the final vote on the McKinley Bill had been 
"taken, Senator Sherman from his place in the Senate urged "
the beneficiaries of the bill not to combine for the suppres 
sion of competition and the enhancement of prices. But 
neither his advice nor his law was much heeded. 

"December 15, 1890, the Chicago Tribune reported one "
"of the promoters of the Barbed Wire Trust, which sub "
sequently became one of the subsidiary trusts or corpora 
"tions of the United States Steel Trust or Corporation, as "
"saying: ""There is no use lying; we are here [in Chicago] "
to form a Wire Trust and raise the price one cent a pound. 
"That is what we propose doing."" "

The first prosecution under the Sherman Act was that 
"against the ""Whiskey Trust."" William H. H. Miller, one "
"of President Harrison s law partners, was still Attorney- "
General and William Howard Taft Solicitor-General. 

"The ""Distillers and Cattle Feeders Trust"" was created "
"by an agreement in writing dated May 10, 1887. Prior "
"to that time it had had more than a nebulous existence, "
for there had been an oral understanding. It was modeled 
after the Standard Oil Trust. Its control was vested in 
a board of trustees. Five different corporations owning and 
"operating distilleries in and about Peoria, Illinois, became "
"its first members. By May 10, 1888, it had absorbed "
eighty-one different distillery corporations and firms operat 
ing distilleries from Maine to California. Many of these 
distilleries had been closed down. All over the country 
41



640 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

similar organizations in almost all lines of manufacturing 
"were being formed. But so far as disclosed, the Whiskey "
Trust was the only combination although they all resorted 
to unfair methods that used dynamite to bring a recal 
citrant into the fold. 

"February n, 1890, in order to clothe the unlawful com "
"bination in legal garb, the trustees of the Distillers and "
Cattle Feeders Trust organized under the laws of Illinois 
the Distilling and Cattle Feeding Company. 

"That eminent counsel, the leaders of the American bar, "
could obtain judicial sanction for the proposition that a 
charter from a State was a license to violate a Federal stat 
"ute, accounts in part for the loss of confidence the Ameri "
can people have manifested in the American bench and bar. 
Behind that New Jersey charter the Standard Oil stood for 
years after it had been run out of Ohio. At the time of 
which I am writing there were Standard Oil people in society 
"in Chicago. The status of that organization, the personnel "
"of many of its members, was well understood. Joseph "
"Medill did not print in his newspaper everything he knew, "
"although he had much to say about ""The Trusts."" "

"In November, 1890, the Treasury Department became "
satisfied something was wrong at Chicago. That was the 
"way Solicitor of the Treasury Hart, three months later, "
began his story to the newspapers. But the most interest 
"ing part, the real history of those extraordinary events, the "
newspapers never published. Mr. Hart was one of the men 
I met when my husband was Postmaster-- General and. later 
when Secretary of the Treasury. He was a member of 
"Congress. I knew Mrs. Hart well, and her daughter, a "
"charming girl, was a friend of my daughter. Mr. Hart had "
"been lieutenant-governor of Ohio, and was practising his "
"profession at Hillsboro, Ohio, when he was made Solicitor "
of the Treasury. 

Ar-cording to Solicitor Hart s statements to the news 
"papers, the Whiskey Trust had attempted to dictate the "



SHERMAN ACT AND MCKINLEY BILL 641 

Illinois appointment in the United States Internal Revenue 
"Service, but had failed. But in confidence, Solicitor of "
the Treasury Hart disclosed to Circuit Judge Gresham 
"that the Trust had put it over"" on the administration. "
The first man Mr. Hart called on when he came to Chicago 
was Judge Gresham. The authorities at Washington sus 
"pected everybody in the Internal Revenue Service in Illinois, "
and almost everybody connected with the administration 
of justice. Solicitor Hart was specific in saying they did 
"not trust Collector of Internal Revenue ""Chris"" Mamer and "
"United States Marshal Hitchcock, both of whom President "
Harrison had appointed. 

The Judge tried to convince the Solicitor that both 
Mamer and Hitchcock were honest men and could be relied 
on to perform any duty that might be imposed on them. 
The Judge showed his confidence in United States District 
"Attorney Thomas E. Milchrist, another appointee, by "
taking Solicitor Hart to the district attorney s office and 
introducing Mr. Hart to Mr. Milchrist. He explained to 
the latter the difficulty the Solicitor of the Treasury seemed 
to think he was in. Mr. Milchrist was positive both Mamer 
and Hitchcock could be relied on. 

Solicitor Hart returned to Washington and came back 
to Chicago. Still they would not trust Mamer and Hitch 
cock. Hitchcock had one time been sheriff of Peoria 
"County, the headquarters of the Trust."" ""But as sheriff "
"of Peoria County he had been a terror to wrongdoers."" "
"Still the Solicitor of the Treasury was obdurate. ""Well,"" "
"said the Judge, ""there is Captain James E. Stewart, the "
chief post-office inspector in charge of this district. I 
have known him for years. He handled many cases for 
the government when I was on the district bench at Indi 
anapolis. He was one of the inspectors when I was post 
master-general upon whom I relied in my war against the 
"Louisiana Lottery. You can trust him."" "

Captain Stewart had graduated from a Wisconsin 



642 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

regiment in 1865 into the postal service. In 1919 he still is 
"the inspector in charge of the Chicago Division, composed of "
"Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Possibly by some the "
criticism may be made of Judge Gresham in this instance 
that some Federal judges would have declined to interfere. 
But certain it is Judge Gresham rendered the administration 
in this matter all the aid any partisan could demand. 

Solicitor Hart returned to Washington. In due time 
an order came from Postmaster-General Wanamaker to 
Post-Office Inspector Stewart to take charge of the inves 
tigation of the violation of the internal revenue laws in 
Illinois. 

John Dewar had been a gauger under President Arthur s 
administration. When the first Cleveland administration 
"came in, in 1885, Dewar made way for a good Democrat, "
and then Dewar went to work for the Whiskey Trust. In 
"July, 1890, Dewar got his place back as a gauger under "
"President Harrison s administration, and was assigned to the "
Shufeldt Distillery. Early in December of that year Dewar 
"received a letter from George J. Gibson, secretary of the "
"Distilling and Cattle Feeding Company at Peoria, stating "
that he wanted to see Dewar about a mistake that had been 
made in his last voucher as an employee of the Distilling 
and Cattle Feeding Company. When Dewar called on Gib 
"son at Peoria, the latter opened up a proposition for Dewar "
to blow up the Shufeldt Distillery. Since the explosion on 
"December 10, I888, 1 Shufeldt and Lynch had maintained a "
"strong guard day and night at the Shufeldt Distillery, and "
only employees and United States Internal Revenue officers 
"could enter its doors. Meanwhile, the Shufeldt was the "
one great competitor of the Trust. Terms were agreed on 
"$25,000 whereby Dewar was to use the apparatus which "
Gibson furnished to destroy the distillery. 

The infernal machine consisted of a tin can in which was 
"a certain liquid, oakum, and a sawed-off Belgian rifle loaded "
with powder and a cone-shaped bullet designed to pierce 

1 See page 620. 



SHERMAN ACT AND MCKINLEY BILL 643 

the bottom of the center vat in the distillery. The piercing 
of the bottom of the vat would release enough combustible 
"and explosive liquid, coming in contact with the burning "
"cotton and oakum in the air, to complete the destruction "
of the distillery. 

But Dewar became conscience-stricken and made a dis 
closure or confession of the scheme to Special Agent Sum- 
"merville of the Internal Revenue Department, who reported "
"to Commissioner Mason, and he in turn to the Secretary "
of the Treasury. It became the subject of a cabinet con 
"ference, and Solicitor Hart went to Chicago. "

"Early in February, 1891, at a conference of United States "
"District Attorney Milchrist, Special Agent Summerville, "
"and Inspector Stewart, it was arranged that Stewart should "
"get the evidence against Gibson, including, if possible, some "
of Gibson s handwriting to compare with Gibson s letter 
to Dewar. 

"A letter was dictated by Stewart for Dewar to copy, and "
then Stewart mailed it to Gibson at Peoria. In speaking of 
"this letter, Stewart said Judge Gresham had early cautioned "
"him in detecting crime, never, as an officer of the govern "
"ment, to advise the commission of a crime, and never to "
take a position that would compromise him before a jury. 
The letter was to the effect that De war s work had taken 
him away from the Shufeldt Distillery; that he was now 
"back; that he was afraid the liquid had lost its strength, and "
he awaited Gibson s further instructions. In this letter a 
code message was prepared so that Gibson could wire De- 
"war what he, Gibson, proposed to do. The night of Feb "
"ruary 8, the letter to Gibson and Inspector Stewart went "
to Peoria. Stewart was in Gibson s office before the letter 
arrived. The inspector was investigating complaints about 
"the failure of carriers to deliver the mails promptly. ""We "
"have no complaint to make. Our service is satisfactory,"" "
"Mr. Gibson said. ""Would the secretary of the Distilling "
and Cattle Feeding Company favor the government of the 



644 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"United States with a statement to that effect?"" Cer "
"tainly,"" replied Gibson. While Gibson was writing out "
"his statement, Stewart saw a clerk lay Dewar s letter to "
"Gibson, which Stewart had mailed the night before in Chi "
"cago, on Gibson s table. Gibson read his tribute to the "
"efficiency of the United States postal service and said, "
Wait a minute and I will have it typewritten. 

Not necessary at all; just sign it and I will take no 
"more of your time."" "

"Gibson signed the paper, and handed it to Stewart, who "
"said, ""Glad we are giving you such good service. Good "
"bye."" "

"Stewart sauntered into other places, but watched. "
Soon Gibson appeared and went to the office of the Mon 
"arch, one of the Trust distilleries; thence to a drug store, "
where he spent some time in the rear of the store. Stewart 
returned to the hotel at which he was stopping and where 
Gibson lived. Taking a block of blank telegrams lying 
"on the customers counter of the hotel telegraph office, "
Stewart turned over the first sheet and wrote on its back 
"his initials, ""J. E. S.,"" and then laid the block back on the "
"counter. Presently Gibson entered the hotel, went up "
"stairs, came down to the telegraph office, and sent a tele "
gram. Then Stewart took the first train back to Chicago. 
"Of course, the telegram beat him there. It advised Dewar "
to meet Gibson at the Grand Pacific Hotel the next morn 
"ing, February 10, 1891. When the Western Union Com "
pany produced the original before the Federal and State 
"Grand Juries, it was in the same handwriting as the letter "
"Gibson had written for Stewart, and on its back was "
J. E. S. 

"At 6:30 A. M., Dewar met Gibson in front of the Grand "
"Pacific Hotel, and as they came into the entrance, Post- "
Office Inspector Stewart and two United States marshals 
took Gibson into custody and to the United States Mar 
shal s office in the Federal Building. From the hotel to 



SHERMAN ACT AND MCKINLEY BILL 645 

the Marshal s office Stewart insisted that Gibson carry his 
"satchel, in order that in any prosecution that might follow, "
the defense could not claim the government officers had 
slipped anything into the satchel. Opening the satchel in 
"the presence of several deputy marshals, it was found to "
contain a bottle filled with liquid and a large number of 
bonds which could readily be turned into currency. 

"Later in the day, Special Agent Summerville, acting "
"under instructions from Solicitor Hart, filed an affidavit "
before United States Commissioner Philip A. Hoyne in 
"which it was charged that on January 25, 1891, George J. "
"Gibson had offered Dewar $25,000 to do and omit to do "
certain acts in violation of his lawful duty as a gauger. 

"In the chapter on the Whiskey Ring of 1875, we have "
"shown that Judge Gresham, who was then the United "
".States district judge for the District of Indiana, construed "
the revenue laws so as to catch all the revenue officers who 
were derelict in their duty to the government. Judge 
"Blodgett, before whom the government had succeeded "
"against the Whiskey Ring of 1875, in the district court for "
"the Northern District of Illinois, was still the judge pre "
"siding in that court and the court in which, under Solicitor "
"Hart s theory, the prosecution must be begun. "

But from here on it must be kept in mind that the Federal 
"statute did not prohibit, with penalties, the gauger from "
committing arson or murder. The acts the Federal statute 
prohibited were failure to observe the exact quantity of 
"spirits produced, running the distillery in the absence of a "
"government officer, and similar acts which would defraud "
the government of its revenues. 

Gibson waived an examination before Commissioner 
"Hoyne, was bound over to the United States Grand Jury "
"and released upon Nelson Morris, one of the directors of "
"the Distilling and Cattle Feeding Company, becoming his "
"surety on a bond in the penalty of $20,000. "

"February 28, 1891, three indictments were returned in "



646 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

the Criminal Court of Cook County against George J. 
"Gibson, one in eight counts for conspiring to commit "
"murder, one in four counts for an attempt to commit "
"arson, and one in twenty-two counts for ""feloniously"" pro "
curing gunpowder for the purpose of unlawfully destroy 
ing life and property. Post-Office Inspector Stewart and 
the other United States officers were named on the back of 
the indictment as the witnesses who had been before the 
Cook County Grand Jury. 

"April 20, 1891, vSolicitor Hart still insisting, the United "
States Grand Jury voted an indictment against Gibson 
tor attempting to bribe an officer of the United States. 

After Thomas E. Milchrist was appointed United States 
"district attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, he "
"appointed John P. Hand, afterwards a member of the "
"Supreme Court of Illinois, his first assistant, and insisted "
"on retaining Oliver E. Pagin, who had come into the office "
a Democrat five years before. Pagin was then an expert 
"in drafting indictments, complying with all the technical "
"and unreasonable rules of the common law courts. Never, "
"it is said, was an indictment drawn by Pagin insufficient "
in form. He is still in the employ of the Department of 
Justice and is to-day the best authority in the United 
States on indictments. 

"At Solicitor Hart s instance, District Attorney Milchrist, "
"accompanied by Mr. Hart, promptly took the indictment "
to Judge Gresham and by them it was carefully examined. 
"Although in the nicest technical form, the Judge was of the "
opinion that the offense charged the attempt to bribe 
Dewar to blow up the Shufeldt Distillery was not an 
offense against the Federal statute. Hart took a copy of 
the indictment and went to Washington. Subsequently 
Solicitor-General Taft wrote District Attorney Milchrist 
that he concurred in Judge Gresham s view. 

Still Hart was not satisfied. He and Milchrist and 
Hand argued out before Judge Blodgett the motion to 



SHERMAN ACT AND MCKINLEY BILL 647 

"quash that John S. Runnells and William Burry, Gibson s "
"lawyers, had made. Mr. Runnells was then the general "
"counsel for the Pullman Company, and one of the best "
"lawyers of his time, and his associate, Mr. Burry, as the "
"saying is, was coming along. June 6, 1891, Judge Blodgett "
quashed the indictment. 

The officers of the Whiskey Trust wanted to go to trial 
"in the State Court and acquit Gibson, as a vindication of the "
Distilling and Cattle Feeding Company. To this end they 
"offered Stewart $100,000 if, as a witness, he would testify "
that after Gibson was arrested at the Grand Pacific Hotel 
an officer took the satchel from him. This would admit 
of the defense that the explosive material was put in the 
satchel by some one other than Gibson. But Stewart was 
obdurate. After several continuances and all pretense 
"over delay had been exhausted, as a trial approached Gib "
"son ""fled the realm."" He went to Cuba and died there. "
"This Gibson incident is said to have cost the ""Trust"" "
"$290,000.00 "

"Of course, the arrest of Gibson was given wide publicity "
in the newspapers. Almost everybody was interviewed. 
"Solicitor Hart said: ""He, Shufeldt, is making money, while "
"the Trust, with $35,000,000, with big salaries and carrying "
"dead plants in its capital account and other expenses, is "
"losing. The Trust might easily put up the price of spirits, "
"but cannot do so as long as the Shufeldt holds out, and it "
would be a mighty good thing for the Trust if the Shufeldt 
"is out of the way."" "

"Thomas Lynch said: ""How such an organization as the "
"Trust is allowed to exist, I cannot understand. It has is "
"sued $35,000,000 of certificates, and I can prove that it is not "
"in possession of more than $4,000,000 worth of property. "

"1 April 9, 1895, John McNulta, Receiver of the Distilling and Cattle Feeding Company, "
"brought suit in the United States Circuit Court at Chicago against J. B. Greenhut, Nelson "
"Morris, Samuel Woolner, and the other directors of the Distilling &amp; Cattle Feeding Company "
"for $290,000, the difference, after allowing for certain legal expenses, between 51,685,000 "
"actually paid November 14, 189.2, for the Star and Crescent and the Nebraska Distilleries, "
"and $1,984,407.83, charged on the books as the purchase price of these distilleries. But the "
"suit was not prosecuted. May 7, 1895, it was dismissed. "



648 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

We have all the orders we can handle. Ours is the largest 
"distillery out of the Trust."" "

"Henry H. Shufeldt said: ""The arrest of Gibson was a "
complete surprise to me. We have fought the Trust 
"right along and do not mean to quit now."" "

"But May i, 1891, Shufeldt and Lynch sold the Shufeldt "
Distillery to the Trust at a good price. The purchase was 
"made through Lyman J. Gage, the president of the First "
"National Bank of Chicago, subsequently the Secretary of "
"the Treasury under President McKinley. Judge Gresham, "
"several years before this, had made some powerful enemies "
when he said from the bench that he did not believe certain 
statements Mr. Gage had made as a witness in open court 
"under oath. Nelson Morris, one of the directors in the "
"Trust, was also a director in Mr. Gage s bank. The trade "
and the world at large soon knew of the purchase by the 
Trust of the Shufeldt Distillery. 

"Because Walter Q. Gresham did not believe that ""the "
"fathers"" contemplated every crime by judicial construction "
"should be drawn into the Federal courts, or, in other words, "
was able to maintain before all comers the proposition that 
while the war legislated it did not destroy the States or 
"local self-government, Benjamin Harrison and William H. H. "
Miller knew that of all men Judge Gresham was for main 
taining all the legitimate and constitutional powers of the 
National government. They complained that as a Federal 
"judge he went too far in upholding these powers, and "
there was judicial warrant for their complaints. They 
said he ought not to push old soldiers to the wall. And 
they knew that for a time he forfeited General Grant s 
friendship when the General s confidence was abused by 
bad and designing men. 

Manifestly there was an offense against the Sherman 
Act. By all the rules for the practical enforcement of the 
"law, the place to have begun the prosecution of the Whiskey "
Trust under the Sherman Act was in the district and circuit 



SHERMAN ACT AND MCKINLEY BILL 649 

courts of the United States for the Northern District of 
Illinois. Within that district were both Peoria and Chi 
cago. At Peoria were all the archives of the combination 
and there it had its inception. 

But instead of beginning the prosecution against the 
"Whiskey Trust in Illinois, under the Sherman Act, the gov "
"ernment of the United States went way down to Boston, "
"and there, March 23, 1891, procured indictments against "
"Joseph B. Greenhut of Peoria, Illinois; Louis H. Green of "
Cincinnati; Warren H. Corning and Julius French of 
"Toledo, Ohio; Herbert L. Terrell of New York, and other "
officers and stockholders of the Distilling and Cattle Feed 
"ing Company of Illinois, none of whom resided in or were "
"citizens of Massachusetts, or even New England. At once "
"Elihu Root and Richard Olney, as attorneys for the de "
"fendants, denied the right of the government of the United "
States -to remove a defendant from his home district to 
a foreign district for trial. In every instance was the 
government defeated. According to the opinion of Judge 
Ricks in the Northern Circuit and Judge Jackson in the 
"Southern District of Ohio, and Judge Lacombe in New York, "
the indictments were not drawn with that technical care 
which the layman not unjustly thinks has become one 
of the reproaches of the legal profession. Circuit Judge 
"Jackson, in an elaborate and forcible opinion which for "
"years was pointed to by the combines as its protection, "
tore the Sherman Act to pieces and refused to enter an 
order for Green s removal to Boston for trial. Finally 
"Judge Nelson, May 16, 1892, in Boston, before whom the "
"indictments were returned, quashed them all (50 F. R. 469). "
In Judge Nelson s opinion occurred this sentence: The 
indictment in this particular is clearly insufficient according 
"to the elementary rules of criminal pleading, and charges "
no offense within the letter or spirit of the second section 
"of the statute."" It is due to Solicitor-General Taft to say "
he had no part in drafting this indictment. 



650 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"On February 18, 1893, President Harrison sent Circuit "
Judge Jackson s name to the Senate as the successor of 
"Justice Lamar, who died January 23, 1893. Think not "
that I am criticizing Judge Jackson s appointment. Long 
before Mr. Cleveland took him from the Senate and made 
"him a circuit judge, he was one of the Southern men with "
"whom, it was said, Walter Q. Gresham was on too intimate "
terms. On the circuit bench Judges Jackson and Gresham s 
relations were most cordial. We visited the Jacksons at 
"West Mead, Tennessee, and they us in Chicago. Judge "
"Jackson was one of the men, who, by word of mouth and "
"letter, urged Judge Gresham to do his duty"" by pub "
licly stating he would vote for Grover Cleveland. But 
how a President who realty wanted the Sherman Act en 
"forced could promote a judge, in every other respect able "
"and capable, who had torn that law to tatters, is a mystery. "

In open court the Harrison administration fared better 
at the hands of Judge Gresham than it did before almost 
any other circuit or district judge. In the celebrated 
"Counselman case, to which we have referred before, the "
"government, in upholding a great piece of remedial and con "
"structive legislation, won, December u, 1890, before Judge "
"Gresham, and lost before the Supreme Court, January n, "
"1892. Afterwards the Supreme Court, when confronted "
in a subsequent case with the consequences of its ruling in 
"the Counselman case, took it back. On the bench passion "
and resentment never affected the judgment of Walter Q. 
Gresham. 

I heard a discussion about one of the anti-trust cases 
that became historic the Sugar Trust case. It was the 
first to get to the Supreme Court of the United States. It 
was at a family dinner at Secretary of the Treasury Car 
"lisle s. Attorney-General Olney, my husband, and a few "
"others were present. The Havemeyers, the heads of this "
"trust, were then much in Washington and in Washington "
society. Their influence in legislation was great. They 



SHERMAN ACT AND MCKINLEY BILL 651 

"had had a hand in drafting the McKinley Bill, and they were "
not without influenee in framing the Wilson-Gorman Bill. 
Grover Cleveland knew them. They were in his mind when 
"he denounced the ""communism of pelf"" in his famous letter "
to Representative Catchings of Mississippi. Night after 
"night, as I shall subsequently show, I sat beside Grover "
"Cleveland at State dinners. Aside from my husband, he "
talked to me with less reserve about men and measures than 
any man ever did. And there were the Sugar senators. 
Many times I have heard them named by Grover Cleve 
land. It will do no good for me to mention them here. 
Walter Q. Gresham denounced them most bitterly. 

Senator Quay opposed the prosecution of the Sugar Trust 
"from the start. What some senators did and denied, Quay "
did in the open. Surely he speculated in sugar stocks and 
voted for the sugar schedules as a means of raising revenue 
and for protection. 

President Harrison was loath to go against the Sugar 
"Trust. But March 4, 1892, the American Sugar Refining "
"Company, a New Jersey corporation, purchased the four "
"sugar refineries, situated in the city of Philadelphia, of the "
"E. C. Knight Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, and "
the pressure became so great that the government was 
forced to proceed. 

"March 21, 1892, Charles H. Aldrich, a Chicago lawyer, "
"able and learned in his profession, succeeded Mr. Taft as "
Solicitor-General. Meantime President Harrison appointed 
Mr. Taft one of the judges of the United States Circuit 
"Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, where he did his "
part in giving life and validity to the Sherman Act. Mr. Al 
drich was sent to Philadelphia to examine the situation. 
He spent several days there. He returned to Washington 
"and redrafted the bill that had been partially prepared, "
and on May 21 filed it in the United States Circuit Court 
at Philadelphia to enjoin the American Sugar Refining 
Company from completing the acquisition of the four 



652 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"Philadelphia refineries of the Knight Company, and from "
restraining trade and commerce between the States. In 
"addition, Mr. Aldrich wanted to proceed by way of indict "
"ment against the officers of the trust, but was not permitted "
to go that far. 

All the evidence to support the government s case was 
prepared before Mr. Cleveland came in as President and 
Mr. Olney as his Attorney-General. Mr. Olney continued 
"Emery P. Ingham, who had been appointed by President "
"Harrison, and a Mr. Russell, the assistant district attorney, "
"to try this ""Sugar case."" January 19, 1894, Ingham and "
"Russell argued the case before Judge Butler. January 30, "
"Judge Butler filed his opinion (60 Fed. R. 306), in w^hich "
he held there was no evidence that there was any purpose 
"to control trade and commerce, only to manufacture, and "
"therefore he dismissed the case. March 26, 1894, the Cir "
cuit Court of Appeals affirmed Judge Butler (60 F. R. 934). 
This time Ingham alone argued the case for the government. 
"But John F. Phillips, the old solicitor-general, and a fine "
"lawyer, was on the brief with Mr. Ingham. "

The case had been tried and lost before Judge Butler 
and the Court of Appeals at Philadelphia and was approach 
ing argument in the Supreme Court when the dinner party 
mentioned above occurred. The case was argued October 
"24, 189^, by Lawrence Maxwell, the Solicitor- General and "
"one of the able lawyers of his time, by Mr. Phillips for the "
"government, and by John G. Johnson and John S. Parsons "
for the Sugar people. At the dinner party Attorney- 
General Olney stated the broad proposition that a mere 
combination of manufacturing was not in contravention of 
the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. My husband agreed with 
"him, but said it would take a very little evidence, ""a "
"scintilla"" outside of the acquisition of many manufacturing "
"plants, to authorize the court to infer that the purpose was "
"to control commerce or traffic; that is, buying and selling "
between the States. 



SHERMAN ACT AND MCKINLEY BILL 653 

"There was nothing in the proofs, said Chief Justice "
"Fuller, in deciding the case, January 21, 1895, ""to indicate "
any intention to put a restraint upon trade or commerce. 
A combination or a monopoly of manufacture is not under 
"ban of the National government."" Justice Harlan dis "
sented from this opinion. 

All the courts through which the case passed said that 
"the bill, as Mr. Aldrich drew it, was good; that it charged a "
combination or monopoly to dominate and control the com 
merce between the States and not a combination simply of 
manufacturing. Mr. Aldrich said the evidence was pre 
pared or gathered to prove that the Sugar Trust was a com 
bination in restraint of trade. It turned out that District 
Attorney Ingham did not put in evidence on the trial before 
Judge Butler the testimony and the documents which proved 
that the purpose of the American Sugar Refining Company 
in acquiring the four refineries of the Knight Company was 
to buy and sell sugar to the citizens of the United States and 
therefore dominate trade and commerce between the States. 
"Afterwards Ingham was indicted, tried, and convicted for "
being a party to a scheme to defraud the government by 
counterfeiting. The only explanation that seems to me 
reasonable is that Ingham had been reached by the officers 
"of the American Sugar Refining Company, and that there "
fore Ingham did not introduce in evidence an essential part 
of the government s case. For later on the American Sugar 
Refining Company and many of its officers were convicted 
of inducing the customs officers to make false statements 
to the Treasury Department of the United States as to the 
"quantity of raw sugar the company was importing, in order "
"to cheat, as it did cheat, the government of the United States "
out of immense sums of revenue. 

Had the Sherman Act been drawn as Senator Sherman 
"originally intended, and enforced as finally written, there "
would probably have been no difficulty about reaching 
the first great combination that the government attempted 
to prosecute. 



654 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

Only in the prosecutions begun against the Trans- 
"Missouri Association, a combination of railroads in which "
"the Harrison administration failed before Judge Rines, did "
the Cleveland administration succeed. Attorney General 
"Harmon argued the case for the government, and the "
"court reversed Judge Rines, holding that the Anti-Trust "
Act applied to railroads the same as to industrial combi 
nations to control trade and commerce between the States. 
But up to that time it had not been enforced against 
"industrial combinations, certainly not against the Whiskey "
and Sugar Trusts. In the debates in Congress the senators 
"and representatives said they meant to reach the ""Sugar "
"Trust,"" the ""Beef Trust,"" the ""Oil Trust, "" the ""Coal Trust,"" "
"the ""Whiskey Trust,"" and other combinations of capital and "
industry. The Supreme Court answered in the language 
of Senator Salisbury of Delaware of 1866. It is not what 
"the Senator, Trumbull, means, that will control the con "
"struction of his amendment, the Thirteenth, to the Consti "
"tution of the United States,- but what is the proper "
conclusion to draw from the language he uses. The Anti- 
"Trust Act was first enforced (54 Fed. Rep. 994, 57 Fed. "
"Rep. 85) against labor men, longshoremen, on a strike at "
New Orleans.

JUDGE GRESHAM S VIEWS ON POPULAR 
GOVERNMENT

A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT HE DECLINES. 

OOON an occasion came when Judge Gresham was 
^ obliged to make his political views public. In Lin 
"coln Park, Chicago, October 7, 1891, an equestrian statue "
of General Grant was to be dedicated under the aus 
"pices of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee, "
"which was to hold its annual reunion October 6, 7, and "
8. Mr. Gresharn was chosen to make the address at the 
dedication. 

Aside from the fact that his military services imposed a 
"duty on him to speak, if it was fair criticism that the ad "
"dress was political in its effect, as it was intended it should "
"be, it was less a political act than for the Supreme Court of "
the United States to amend an act of Congress by writing 
"the word ""reasonable"" into the Sherman Act in the Stand "
ard Oil and Tobacco cases after Congress had expressly re 
"fused to make that amendment, and that, too, after Justice "
Harlan in his oral opinion in open court warned his breth 
ren that the oral opinion of Chief Justice White as just de 
livered and subsequently reduced to writing was legislation 
pure and simple. 

After what President Angell of the University of Michi 
gan said was one of the best delineations of General Grant s

656 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"character that was ever made, after stating that brave "
and generous men will not censure the ex-Confederates 
for cherishing an affectionate regard for one another and for 
"strewing flowers on the graves of their fallen comrades, he "
set forth his views on political matters in a way that he 
could not have done had he accepted the overtures of Platt 
and Quay in the Chicago Republican Convention of 1888. 

It is a mistake to suppose that popular government is an 
art or a mystery. Some of the details of administration require 
"special training and experience. But in its broad policies, in "
"the adjustment of it to the ends for which it was organized, in "
"the promotion of its purposes, men like Grant, who feel rightly "
"and see clearly, who have a sound judgment, and saving common- "
"sense, and who will resolutely assert themselves under all cir "
"cumstances, may be safely trusted with its affairs and destinies. "
We need men possessing these qualities to resist the aggressions 
of those who seek to make of our politics both an art and a mys 
"tery, intelligible only to the adept and initiated, who assume the "
management of them by virtue of their capacity for the deft and 
artful manipulation of their fellows. Their influence upon the 
"country is corrupt and debasing, and the area of political venality "
constantly enlarges under it. According to their views the whole 
"interest that any citizen has in Municipal, State, or National "
Government is measured by what he can make out of it. It 
is worse than idle to shut our eyes to the existence of cor 
rupt methods and practices in our politics which threaten to 
subvert our free institutions. 

The man who accepts a bribe of any sort places his conscience 
and judgment in the vilest bondage. He is no longer free. Argu 
ment is wasted on him. Considerations of the public weal or 
woe do not affect him. Bayonets at the polls would not control 
his conduct more effectively. And men who contribute money 
"to buy votes and to bribe the people s representatives, as well as "
"those who disburse it, are deadly enemies of the republic. They "
"may masquerade in the garb of righteousness, but their virtues "
"are assumed; they are hypocrites and assassins of liberty, and "
would welcome a dynasty rather than shed their blood in defense 
of popular government. 



VIEWS ON POPULAR GOVERNMENT 657 

Let us not be deceived by mere forms. Radical changes in 
government may be effected without perceptible change in the 
mode of administration. Some of the worst tyrannies the world 
has ever known were maintained under popular forms. 

"Engrossed in the cares of business and laborious occupations, "
"men seem inattentive to the requirements of citizenship, but they "
do not consciously and willfully shirk its duties and responsi 
bilities when they are clearly and fully understood. They may 
"be slow to act, but when danger becomes imminent they will "
assert themselves again as they have in the past. The sentiment 
of patriotism is still strong in the people. Its voice may be un 
"heeded for a season, and may be drowned by the noisier tongues "
"of greed and selfishness, but it will be heard again. It patiently "
"submits to many affronts, and quietly endures many indignities. "
"But in its temporary silence it gathers an accumulation of energy, "
"and when the limit of endurance has been reached, its command "
"ing voice breaks forth on the startled air, trump^t-tongued, and "
against its mighty tones no other voice dares lift itself. 

"Our Republic was founded in the patriotism of the people, "
and their love of country was strengthened by the struggle for 
its defense against foreign aggression. The Revolutionary War 
was a test of the popular patriotism which had been previously 
"implanted, rather than a development of it. The patriotism "
"which was ablaze in the speeches of Otis and Adams and Henry, "
"and in the intrepid conduct of Warren and Marion, was a steady "
and fervent heat in the bosoms of thousands whose names are 
unknown to history. As a people we have inherited the patriot 
"ism of our Revolutionary sires, and the inheritance has not been "
squandered nor dissipated. 

The vast majority of the people arc patriotic and sound to 
the core. In them is our mainstay and chief dependence. Our 
"confidence in their steady and unfaltering love of country, which "
"is indifferent about any show of itself and speaks only in its acts, "
will never be misplaced. It was this sort of patriotism that was 
personified in Grant. 

"The newspapers gave this speech wide publicity, both "
in their news columns and in editorial comment. Although 
"Joseph Medill never abated his friendship for Mr. Gresham, "



658 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"he thought ""the Judge went it a little strong."" But he did "
not criticize. As a sample of the newspaper comment - 
and it was almost universally favorable Morris Ross in 
the Indianapolis News said the conditions of the times 
"demanded that some one speak out, and that the Judge "
bit nigh. One of the most flattering comments was by 
an English paper. From Samuel Blackford of the Supreme 
"Court, from college professors and presidents, from Union "
and Confederate veterans and from newspaper men like 
"Walter Wellman, came letters and editorials of commenda "
tion by the hundred. 

The only discordant note came from Chauncey M. 
"Depew. The newspaper men reported him as saying, in "
response to the question as to what he thought of Judge 
"Gresham s Grant monument speech, ""Judge Gresham is no "
diplomat . 

The reunion of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee 
"ended with a banquet at the Palmer House, and General "
Andrew J. Hickenlooper of Cincinnati delivered the annual 
"address. Even then the ranks were getting thin, so ladies "
were permitted to be present. At my husband s earnest 
"request, Henry Watterson accepted an invitation to come "
to the dinner and respond to one of the toasts Grant s 
"words, ""Let us have peace. It was thus that I heard ""Marse "
"Henry."" Speaking of it years afterwards, James Whitcomb "
"Riley, who was also there as a guest and responded to the "
"toast, ""The Common Patriot,"" said: ""I will never forget "
"the emotion Marse Henry exhibited on that occasion."" "
"With three such gifted men as Henry Watterson, James "
"Whitcomb Riley, and Joseph Medill on its program, the "
banquet was all that my husband could desire. Mr. 
"Medill s subject was ""The Legal Press in the War for the "
"Union."" Endowed with qualities of heart and brain, when "
"the final record is made up, Watterson will be placed as the "
leader who broke through the restraint that existed in spite 
of all the declarations that the bitterness engendered by the 



VIEWS ON POPULAR GOVERNMENT 659 

"war had subsided. Whether right or wrong, the man who "
can make the first advance towards a reconciliation is a 
"great man, a leader, and a patriot. And right alongside of "
"Watterson in this patriotic work was ""Private John"" M. "
"Allen of Topeka, Mississippi. To be able to break through "
"the ice that I know only too well existed, and make your "
"enemy, if you please, love you, is something more than the "
attribute of mere man. 

Among the letters that came from ex-Confederates was 
"one from Blanton Duncan, whom, as we have seen, had led "
a regiment of Kentuckians to the Confederacy in 1861. He 
"was then living in Los Angeles. Always alert, he had been "
through the South and in touch with the Farmers Alliance. 
"He claimed they had control of the Southern States, that "
they had even secretly organized negro lodges in which 
"they controlled 1,800,000 negro voters. This organization, "
"united with that in the West, he said would control the "
"country, and the man to head the ticket was Judge Gresham. "
My husband answered Mr. Duncan by saying that he would 
not accept the nomination of the People s or any other party 
if offered him. 

"Captain C. A. Pow r er, a Union veteran of Terre Haute, "
"Indiana, as a delegate to the preliminary conference of the "
"People s party held at St. Louis, February 22, 1892, said "
that the machinery would be put to work to nominate 
Judge Gresham at the People s party convention to be held 
"three months later. To Captain Power Mr. Gresham wrote, "
"on the i6th of February, 1892, as follows: "

I am out of politics and have no political aspirations. While 
I have said to a number of my Republican friends that I am not 
"willing my name should go before the Minneapolis convention, I "
have not felt called upon to make a public announcement of the 
fact. 

You are not mistaken in supposing that I am a firm believer 
in popular government. The public welfare should be the aim 
of all legislation. A man who does not love the human race 



660 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

and desire the elevation of the masses is not to be trusted as a 
friend of free institutions. I do not express these views in the 
"hope of recommending myself to you, and association with you "
"in political action, as a fit person to lead your movement; I am "
not such a person. 

"And in similar strain letters were written to others, "
"including James L. Orr of Denver, the chairman of the "
People s party committee after the St. Louis conference. 

A movement was on foot to defeat President Harri 
son s renomination at the Republican Convention to be held 
"at Minneapolis. Senator Quay, ex-Senator Platt, Major "
"William McKinley, then Governor of Ohio; ex-Governor "
"Foraker, and ex-Speaker Thomas B. Reed, still in Congress "
"from Maine, united in the plan. Quay was first in the "
"field. January 13, 1892, at Liberty Hall, on German- "
"town Avenue in Philadelphia, in the Fifth Congressional "
"District, Messrs. Martin and McKinley were elected del "
egates to the Minneapolis Convention over William R. 
"Leeds, who was the United States marshal for the "
"Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and Charles W. Henry, "
collector of internal revenue for that district. Messrs. 
Leeds and Henry were the administration candidates. 
The election of Martin and McKinley was a great sur 
"prise, apparently, to the country at large. Associated with "
Senator Quay in this movement were John L. Elkins and 
P. A. B. Widener of the Elkins-Widener Street Car Syn 
"dicate, and Hamilton Disson, the Philadelphia manufac "
"turer, who had been a Grant delegate in 1880, an Arthur "
"delegate in 1884, and one of Quay s delegates in 1888. "
Disson all along professed great friendship for Gresham. 
Elkins and Disson became two of the delegates-at-large 
from Pennsylvania in 1892 to the Minneapolis Convention. 

"January 15, 1892, Mr. Widener wrote Judge Gresham "
that if he would consent to be a candidate for the Presi 
"dency, he and his friends would be glad to support him, "
and that he thought Senator Quay and the senatorial 



VIEWS ON POPULAR GOVERNMENT 661 

combine that would soon caucus in Washington would 
take Gresham as a candidate. Mr. Widener was the man 
Senator Quay sent to Joseph Medill in 1888. Promptly 
a courteous letter was written Mr. Widener declining this 
offer. 

Soon after this Judge Gresham met Senator Quay 
in New York. In response to questions the Senator ad 
mitted he had put Widener up to writing the letter just 
"referred to, and also conveyed his intention to prevent "
President Harrison s renomination. Then Mr. Gresham 
told Mr. Quay that never again would he permit his 
name to be used in a National convention. He told ex- 
"Senator Platt the same thing, and he said to each, ""You "
can not defeat President Harrison s renomination. With 
"practically no party in the South, only officeholders, any "
Republican administration that will use its power can 
"renominate itself."" "

Quay proceeded with his work and rounded up practi 
cally all the Pennsylvania delegates. Platt did likewise 
"in New York, while McKinley and Foraker had Ohio unan "
"imous, and in the other Republican States the opposition "
to the President was manifest by the returns. But in the 
rotten burroughs of the South  the President was supreme. 

"Again, on June 3, 1892, Mr. Widener sent a messenger, "
"John A. Glenn of Philadelphia, bearing a letter to Judge "
"Gresham, because he had no time to come himself, and, "
"as he wrote, it would not do to commit to paper what he "
desired to communicate. The message was from Senator 
Quay and stated that they would nominate Gresham if he 
would be a candidate. The combine controlled the Repub 
"lican National Committee, they would name a temporary "
chairman who would rule that officeholders from the South 
"were not entitled to vote, and thus they would have a "
majority of the disinterested delegates. Civil service rules 
and all kinds of pretexts could be invoked. Quay had 
"boldly and openly killed President Harrison s pet measure, "



662 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"The Force Bill, to make the Southern States Repub "
"lican. Why, then, should Quay let the delegates from "
"those ""rotten burroughs"" rule him when he had a Na "
tional Committee that would do his bidding? He had the 
"nerve to act, and now Platt was the follower. "

"Judge Gresham s answer was spoken plainly: ""Go "
back and tell Mr. Widener my position is the same as I 
"stated it to Senator Quay three months ago, and the Sen "
"ator should know better than to send me such a message."" "

"This answer, when Glenn delivered it to Widener, "
"made him very angry at Senator Quay for causing him, "
"Widener, to write and send the letter. Widener declared "
then that he and his Pennsylvania friends would show 
Quay they were not puppets in his hands. And this is the 
"way they did it, Elkins, Widener s partner, Disson, most "
of the other Philadelphia delegates and two outside of the 
"city, making nine in all out of sixty, voted for General "
"Harrison s renomination. Afterwards, Senator Quay said "
that Judge Gresham s answ r er to Widener was one of the 
"worst jolts he ever received. The Elkins- Widener Syndicate, "
"Disson, and Daniel I. Martin continued their opposition "
"to Senator Quay, but were finally and completely defeated "
"in 1895, when they again acknowledged the Quay scepter. "
"June 4, 1892, Mr. Elaine resigned as Secretary of State. "
"Then Mr. Blaine, Major McKinley, and President Harri "
"son were voted for in the convention, the President being "
"renominated. One thing Matthew Stanley Quay never did, "
and that was to vote for James G. Blaine in a National 
convention. Senator Quay and his Pennsylvania dele 
"gates, except the Elkins- Widener Syndicate, voted for Ma "
jor McKinley. Platt voted his New York delegates for 
"Blaine, while Senator Foraker voted Ohio for McKinley. "

That Platt and Quay might have compassed their pur 
pose to defeat the renomination of President Harrison is 
probable. They named the temporary chairman of the 
"convention, one of Platt s men, J. Sloat Fassett. Major "



VIEWS ON POPULAR GOVERNMENT 663 

William McKinley was made permanent chairman. On 
one preliminary proposition Major McKinley ruled that 
an office-holding delegate whose seat was contested could 
not vote. The adoption of that rule would have given 
Theodore Roosevelt the control of the 1912 convention and 
would have renominated Roosevelt instead of Taft. 

After demonstrating what they could do in making it 
apparent that without his officeholders President Harrison 
"was in a hopeless minority, Senator Quay, on the floor of "
"the convention, said: ""We will no longer prolong the con "
"test on these lines."" "

"The People s party assembled at Omaha July 4, and "
"although Judge Gresham had repeatedly, during the pre "
"ceding three months, notified its leaders he could not "
"accept their nomination, they wanted to draft him. The "
Vincents after the clean-up in Kansas had moved the Non 
conformist to Indianapolis and w r ere insisting that Judge 
Gresham be nominated without his consent. Republicans 
"and Democrats, men of character and influence, practical "
"politicians of great influence east of the Mississippi, men "
"who never afterwards broke their party allegiance, came "
"forward and said, ""If you take the nomination, we will vote "
for you. Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll from the Repub 
licans and Senator D. W. Voorhees from the Democrats 
"said, ""We will support you on the -stump."" Lawyers, "
"judges, newspaper men, including editorial writers, urged "
"him to say he would accept. T. V. Powderly, the head of "
"the Knights of Labor, and General J. B. Weaver of Iowa, "
who was subsequently made the nominee of the People s 
"party at Omaha, united in a telegram with others asking "
that the nomination be accepted. The final answer was 
"as it had been from the beginning: ""While I agree with "
"the People s party on some questions, I do not on others "
"and can not accept."" "



CHAPTER XLII 
DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION OF 1892 



GROVER CLEVELAND NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT THE 

"PLATFORM THE TARIFF "" PLANK"" CAUSES MAJORITY AND "

MINORITY REPORTS THE MINORITY REPORT ADOPTED AS 

THE PLATFORM. 

I SAT with my husband on the platform when Calvin S. 
Brice called the Democratic Convention cf 1892 to 
"order, and we witnessed many of its proceedings. The "
"convention was held in a wigwam built on the Lake Front, "
"Chicago. While the hall had a large seating capacity, it "
was a monstrosity in every other way. 

The sentiment of the masses of Chicago seemed to favor 
the nomination of Grover Cleveland. The preliminary 
"work for the World s Fair was going on, and I saw many "
"men from all parts of the country, and heard much of "
the talk that preceded the convention. Many of the rich 
"men, our neighbors, were opposed to Mr. Cleveland s "
"nomination. They made much of Calvin S. Brice, then "
a Senator from Ohio and chairman of the Democratic 
National Committee. They said Mr. Cleveland could not 
possibly secure the nomination because the delegates from 
his own State would be against him. My husband told 
"them that even with the New York delegates against him, "
Mr. Cleveland s nomination could not be prevented. I was 
"greatly interested in the situation, and thus it was that "
I insisted on attending the convention. 

"There was the New York delegation, led. by Tammany "
and supporting David B. Hill. Our friend Henry Wat- 
"terson was present, attempting to lead the Kentuckians "
against Grover Cleveland. Governor Horace Boies of Iowa 

664



DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION OF 1892 665 

"was Walter son s candidate. William C. Whitney, Don "
"M. Dickinson of Michigan, and Senator William F. Vilas "
"of Wisconsin, who had been members of Mr. Cleveland s "
"cabinet, were in charge of Cleveland s forces. After the "
"preliminary organization, and after the Committees on "
"Credentiils and the Platform had gone out, there were "
speeches by a number of gentlemen. Senator John M. 
"Palmer spoke first, but as one old fellow who sat behind me "
"said, the general s eloquence did not set the prairies afire. "

"Congressman William L. Wilson of Viginia, who wa s "
"known to voice Mr. Cleveland s views, made a speech in "
"which he advocated a reduction of the tariff, but keeping "
in mind the interests of the manufacturers that had been 
"fostered by the tariff, saying they should have time to "
"adjust themselves before putting into effect new schedules, "
"he attacked the McKinley tariff, but did not advocate Henry "
Watterson s tariff for revenue only. This gave us the cue 
to what the contest would be in the Committee on Resolu 
tions. There it waged long. 

"Finally, on the third day, after an all-night session, "
Senator Vilas read the report of the Committee on Resolu 
"tions, that is, the report of the majority of the committee. "
There was a single dissent Lawrence J. Neal of Ohio 
made a minority report. The only difference was on the 
"tariff ""plank,"" and to only part of that, as reported, was "
objection made. As these planks had a bearing on my 
"husband s position I give them here, and the debate that "
"followed on the motion of Mr. Neal, seconded by Henry "
"Watterson, to substitute Mr. Neal s plank for that of the "
committee. 

We reiterate the oft-repeated doctrine of the Democratic party 
that the necessities of the government arc the only justification for 
"taxation, and whenever a tax is unnecessary it is unjustifiable. "

That when custom taxation is levied upon articles of any 
"kind produced in this country, the difference between the cost "
"of labor here and labor abroad, when such a difference exists, "



666 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

fully measures any possible benefits to labor; and the enormous 
additional impositions of the existing tariff fall with crushing force 
"upon our farmers and working men, and for the mere advantage "
of the few whom it enriches exacts from labor a grossly unjust 
share of the expenses of government; and we demand such a 
revision of the tariff laws as will remove every iniquitous ine 
"quality, lighten every oppression, and put them on a constitutional "
and equitable basis. 

But in making a reduction in taxes it is not proposed to injure 
"any domestic industries, but rather to promote their healthy "
growth. From the foundation of this government taxes collected 
by the Custom House have been the chief source of Federal revenue. 
"Such they must continue to be. Moreover, many industries "
"have come to rely upon legislation for successful continuance, so "
that any change of law must be at every step regardful of the 
labor and capital thus involved. The process of reform must 
be subject in its execution to this plain dictate of justice. 

We denounce the McKinley Law enacted by the P^ifty-first 
Congress as the enormity and atrocity of class legislation. 

Lawrence T. Neal s proposed substitute was as follows: 

We denounce Republican protection as a fraud a robbery 
of the great majority of the American people for the benefit of 
the few. We declare it to be the fundamental principle of the 
Democratic party that the Federal government has no consti 
tutional power to impose and collect tariff duties except for the 
"purpose of revenue only, and we demand that the collection of "
such taxes shall be limited to the necessities of the government 
when honestly and economically administered. 

The debate was short and crisp. Senator Vilas read 
the majority plank and said not another word. Mr. Neal 
read the substitute and spoke in its support. Henry Wat- 
terson followed Mr. Neal. He asked the secretary to read 
the tariff for revenue only plank of the platform of the Dem 
ocratic party of 1876. While it was being read Mr. Watter- 
"son stood silent, the admiration of friend and foe in the "
"convention. All he .said was: ""I saw it confirmed in 1888. "
"The majority report is the platform of James G. Blaine."" "



DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION OF IS 02 667 

Senator Vilas answered: : The majority report is the 
"Democratic platform of 1884, and Henry Watterson helped "
"with the preparation of the 84 platform."" "

Mr. Watterson replied: i4 Since then we have had the 
Morrison Bill and the Mills Bill and Cleveland s tariff mes 
"sage of 1887, and are you now going back to the straddle "
"of 1884?"" My husband said a lawyer would hardly have "
cited Cleveland s message of 1887 in support of a tariff for 
revenue only. 

Mr. Neal s motion prevailed by a vote of 564 to 342. 

The Courier Journal s account of this debate is inter 
esting and illuminating: 

As the young Hercules of Democracy stood on the platform 
"waiting for the cheers to subside, he presented the appearance "
"of a lion eager to jump on his prey. He faced 20,000 people, all "
eyes upon him. He knew with whom he had to deal. He knew 
that Cleveland himself was back of the assault upon tariff reform 
which had been made by Cleveland s own lieutenants in the 
convention. 

"After what occurred to-night, set on foot by the friends of "
"Grover Cleveland, and which resulted in their disaster, I feel "
satisfied that if the convention had had another day without 
"making the nomination of the ex- President ., he would have been "
"beaten, as he richly deserved to be. This is not the first time "
"Cleveland had attempted to straddle on the tariff question, and "
the magnificent Democratic victory to-night should be a lesson 
to him and his followers. 

And where stood Henry Watterson! Not with the Platform 
"Committee, but on the floor among the boys in the trenches, and "
you can bet he got on the committee with both feet when the 
occasion required that he should resent a stinging insult to the 
Star-eyed Goddess of Reform. 

There was a single ballot. Mr. Cleveland received the 
conventional Democratic two- thirds and was nominated. 
"The vote was: Cleveland 617, Hill 114, Boies 103, Gorman "
"36, Stevenson 16, Carlisle 14. "



668 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"In notifying Mr. Cleveland of his nomination, Mr. Wil "
"son, as the spokesman of the Committee, ignored tariff for "
"revenue only, came out for a downward revision of the "
"tariff, and then Mr. Cleveland in his letter of acceptance "
responded as follows: 

Tariff reform is still our purpose. Though we oppose the 
theory that tariff laws may be passed having for their object the 
granting of discriminating and unfair governmental aid to private 
"ventures, we wage no exterminating war against any American "
interests. We believe readjustment can be accomplished in 
accordance with the principles we profess (taxation for the pur 
"pose of maintaining the government), without disaster or demo "
lition. We believe that the advantages of freer raw material 
"should be accorded to our manufacturers, and we contemplate "
a fair and careful distribution of necessary tariff burdens rather 
than the precipitation of free trade. 

We anticipate with calmness the misrepresentation of our 
motives and purposes instigated by a selfishness which seeks to 
hold in unrelenting grasp its unfair advantage under present 
tariff laws. We will rely on the intelligence of our fellow-country 
men to reject the charge that a party comprising a majority of 
our people is planning the destruction or injury of American 
interests; we know they cannot be frightened by the specter of 
impossible free trade. 

After the publication of Mr. Cleveland s letter of accept 
"ance, Joseph Medill said, ""We will now be unable to dis "
tinguish Henry Watterson from an old Henry Clay Protec 
tionist Kentucky Whig until after the election. Ever since 
"1872, when Marse Henry supported Horace Greeley, he "
has had ague fits of protection just before election. He is 
now for a tariff for revenue with incidental protection. He 
will not recover until just after the 8th of November. 1 

After Mr. Cleveland had been nominated my husband 
"said to W. C. Whitney and Thomas F. Bayard, ""You will "
"carry Indiana certain, so instead of nominating Isaac P. "
"Gay, nominate some good man from Illinois and carry this "
"State."" And Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois was nominated. "

by a close friend of President Harrison that Judge Gresham

"Court, and several were not far off. At this time newspaper "
"comment in this connection became embarrassing, so it was "
"announced that a position in the Supreme Court, if offered "

that Judge Gresham would vote for Mr. Cleveland. News 
paper men and personal friends importuned him to know 
his position. Pressure was exerted to keep him quiet and 
also to give the public the benefit of his views. Letters of 
inquiry came by the hundreds. To his personal friends it 
seemed best that he should disclose his position. Candor 
"required it. To W. B. Slemmons 1 of Cory don, Indiana, the "

670 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

I have your letter of yesterday. I have made no public 
announcement of how I shall vote this fall and it is not my inten 
tion to make any. I shall give no interviews; I have written no 
"letters. However, I will say to you, but not for publication, that "
I expect to vote for Air. Cleveland because I agree with him on 
the tariff question. I supported the ticket in good faith in 88. 
I fully realize the seriousness of the step I have resolved to take. 
"It will likely call down abuse, ridicule, and misrepresentation, and "
it means the loss of many old and valued friends. I shall simply 
be true to my convictions. I can gain nothing by such a course. 
"I am willing for others to think and act for themselves, and if I "
"am censured for exercising the same privilege, I must and can "
stand it. If I did not disagree with the Republican part} T on 
"fundamental issues, I would vote its ticket, whateA T er I might "
think of its candidates. 

About this time I went with my husband to Indianapolis 
"to visit our friends, Air. and Mrs. A. C. Harris. To Air. "
"Harris, a lifelong Republican, and to C. W. Fairbanks, "
"afterwards Vice-President, my husband clearly made known "
his support of tariff reduction and his purpose to vote for 
Mr. Cleveland. 

From Indianapolis Judge Gresham started for Spring 
"field, Illinois, to sit with Judge Allen in some cases the judge "
wanted him to hear with him. On the way he stopped at 
"Terre Haute to accept an invitation, which Senator Voor- "
"hees, John E. Lamb, and Crawford Fairbanks had previ "
"ously sent him, to visit them and see the horse races, which "
were then a new feature of that growing and prosperous 
"city. On a beautiful afternoon they saw ""Nancy Hanks"" "
"lower the record for trotting horses from 2 :o8 to 2 -.04, In "
"the evening at dinner at Air. Fairbanks residence, there "
was a full discussion of men and measures. Always a 
"Democrat, but for a tariff for revenue with at least inci "
"dental protection, Senator Voorhees was glad that Judge "
"Gresham would vote for Cleveland, although he criticized "
"Cleveland severely. His personal dislike for Cleveland, "
"like that of many of the men of his party, was very strong. "



SECRETARY OF STATE 671 

Crawford Fairbanks was of that practical type of man 
"who saw things clearly. When very young, he had gone "
"into the army in the middle of the war, but not too late to "
"eain a commission. Originally a Republican, he had long "
been a Democrat; he had gone to the Democratic party on 
account of his opposition to sumptuary legislation. That 
"the high schedules of the McKinley Bill fostered the trusts, "
Mr. Fairbanks frankly avowed. As a business man and a 
"speculator, he grasped the opportunity the situation pre "
"sented. Long before the Sherman Act was passed, Fair "
banks was in the business of assembling or putting together 
competing manufacturing plants. The sale of his dis 
tillery to the trust released a lot of capital. Soon after the 
"Sherman Act was passed, he was a party to a combination "
that was organized in the office of John W. Herron in Cin 
cinnati. Mr. Herron was simply doing what almost every 
leading lawyer of that time did. He was the father-in-law 
"of William H. Taft, who was still Solicitor-General. There "
was a great contest among the mill owners as to who should 
be president of the new trust. One faction wanted Craw 
ford Fairbanks to be the head of the new organization. 
"But "" Banks,"" as everybody called him, said, ""No, let me "
"be treasurer."" After the organization was perfected, at "
"dinner in the old St. Nicholas Hotel, ""Banks"" told his par "
"ticular friends why he wanted to be treasurer. ""No matter "
what the lawyers say about drawing the articles so as not 
"to conflict with the Sherman Act, some judge is likely to "
come along and declare our organization an unlawful com 
"bine or trust. If so, and I am treasurer, I will be in a posi "
tion to hang onto my own money. And then the judge 
"might go farther and say, I won t soil my hands with this "
"tainted money, and then I will hold the whole jack pot. "
"Let him who wants to, pose as president; I want to be "
"treasurer."" "

Most of the beneficiaries of the tariff could not look 
"at the situation as Fairbanks did. Senator Voorhees, Mr. "
43



672 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"Lamb, and Mr. Fairbanks thought Judge Gresham should "
make a public statement of his position. The practical 
business man was exemplified in Fairbanks in that he did 
"not believe, as he said, that ""Judge Gresham could stand "
"the pressure and make a public statement."" "

"After a short term of court at Springfield, Mr. Gresham "
returned to Chicago and was confronted with the statement 
"of Secretary of the Treasury Charles Foster of Ohio, who "
"was campaigning in New York, and other speakers, that "
it was untrue that Judge Gresham was out of harmony 
with the Republican party on the tariff question and would 
vote for Mr. Cleveland. A like statement was issued from 
the Republican National Committee. It was even said 
that the Republican managers proposed to issue a forged 
"letter, with Your name to it, making you out a supporter "
"of General Harrison."" Newspaper men like Walter Well- "
man and Morris Ross wrote him powerful letters about 
his duty to let the country know his views. These state 
"ments, appeals, and protests finally decided Judge Gresham "
that he owed it to himself to set before the country his 
position. After it had been decided that the best *way to 
"do so would be to write a letter to some well-known man, "
the question as to whom this man should be was much 
"discussed. He must be a man of character, with no "
embarrassing or entangling alliances. Many names were 
considered and rejected. Finally Major Bluford Wilson 
"was decided on, and the following letter was addressed "
to him: 

"CHICAGO, ILL., Oct. 27, 1892. "
"To THE HON. BLUFORD WILSON, "

"SPRINGFIELD, ILLINOIS. "
DEAR MAJOR: 

I have your letter of the 2ist inst. I did tell you at Spring 
field that after mature reflection I had determined to vote for 
Mr. Cleveland this fall because I agree in the main with his views 
on the tariff and did not believe in the principles embodied in the 



SECRETARY OF STATE 673 

McKinley Bill. I adhere to that determination and have said 
nothing indicating a change of purpose. 

It is not true that with my knowledge or consent the President 
was asked to appoint me to any office. It is not true that I 
requested any one to do anything to obtain the Republican 
nomination this year. 

It is not true that I voted for Mr. Cleveland in 1888. I voted 
the Republican ticket at every Presidential election since the 
"party was organized, except in 1864, when I was not able to go "
to the polls. 

The Republicans were pledged to a reduction of the war 
"tariff long before 1888, and during the campaign of that year the "
pledge was renewed with emphasis again and again. 

"Instead of keeping that promise, the McKinley Bill was "
"passed, imposing still higher duties. It was passed in the interests "
of the favored classes and not for the benefit of the whole people. 
It neither enhances the price of farm products nor benefits labor. 
Wages are and ever will be regulated by supply and demand. 
Duties were imposed upon some articles so as to destroy com 
petition and foster trusts and monopolies. I think you will 
agree with me that this was an abandonment of the doctrine of 
moderate incidental protection. The tariff is now the most 
"important question before the people, and whatever others may "
"do, I shall exercise the right of individual judgment, and vote "
"according to my convictions. I think, with you, that a Republi "
can can vote for Mr. Cleveland without joining the Democratic 
party. How I shall vote in the future will depend upon the 
questions at issue. 

"Yours very truly, "

W. Q. GRESHAM. 

On a dining car going out of Chicago on the Chicago &amp; 
"Eastern Railroad, Crawford Fairbanks and a number of "
men were talking politics. One had been deriding one of 
the waiters who in response to a question said he would 
"vote for Grover Cleveland. Finally the negro said, ""Judge "
Gresham says the niggers don t have to vote the Republi 
can ticket no more. Mister Quay he done changed the 
constitution of the Republican party. He puts the dollar 



674 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

before the man. Abraham put the man before the dollar. 

Meanwhile the Democratic National Committee got in 
"touch with the People s party organization, with the result "
"that the Democrats put up no electors in Kansas, Nebraska, "
"Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, and Wyoming. Whether or not "
Mr. Cleveland knew about this I do not know. But I do 
"know that William C. Whitney and Mr. Harrity, who was "
"chairman of the Democratic National Committee, knew "
of it and arranged all the details. The Democrats could 
"not possibly carry Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Idaho, "
"Nevada, and Wyoming. To cast the electoral votes of "
these States for General Weaver might prevent an election 
in the electoral college. Should the election go into the 
"House, the Democrats were there in a large majority in "
"a vote by States, so that Mr. Cleveland would be elected. "

Because Walter Q. Gresham did not agree with the 
"People s party, in all things, he did not think he should "
scorn or ridicule them. And after he declined their offer 
"he wrote General Weaver a cordial personal letter, which "
was promptly answered. They had met during the Civil 
War. 

Back of the People s party organization were the silver 
mines of the mountain States. It is due to Mr. Cleveland 
to say here that he was in 1892 opposed to the unlimited 
coinage of silver and also had been opposed in 1890 to 
"coinage at the rate of 800,000 ounces per month; that is, "
to the enactment of the Sherman Silver Law. Every well 
informed man who voted for him knew this. It clears 
him of all the charges of want of candor that were after 
wards brought against him by the friends of silver. That 
he was not as tactful in dealing with them as he might have 
"been, and could still have been firm and maintained the "
gold standard and perhaps not have subjected the country 
"to the strain of the campaign of 1896, may well be asserted. "

Mr. Cleveland had a majority over General Harrison 
and General Weaver in the electoral college. The vote 



SECRETARY OF STATE 675 

"stood, Cleveland, 277, Harrison, 145, Weaver, 22. Con "
"sidering the increase in population, General Harrison and "
the Republican party fared badly at the hands of the 
voters. Transferring Democratic votes to Weaver in 
"Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, and Wyo "
"ming, held Mr. Cleveland s popular vote down. William "
"Jennings Bryan, for example, voted for Weaver. The pop "
"ular vote was: Cleveland, 5,556,562; Harrison, 5,162,894; "
"Weaver, 1,055,424; Bidwell, Prohibitionist, 264,066. In "
"1888, in the nation at large, the vote was: Cleveland, "
"5,538,560; Harrison, 5,441,902; while the electoral vote was : "
"Harrison, 233; Cleveland, 168. In Indiana in 1892 the "
"vote was: Cleveland, 262,740; Harrison, 255,615; Weaver, "
"22,208; Bidwell, 13,050. In 1888, it was: Harrison, 263,- "
"361; Cleveland, 261,013. As Judge Gresham predicted to "
"William C. Whitney and Thomas F. Bayard, Illinois voted "
for Cleveland. 

"Following the election, the Chicago Tribune and the "
Chicago Inter-Ocean especially the Inter-Ocean were very 
critical toward Mr. Gresham in their editorials. Their 
criticisms brought forth defenses from friends. One of 
"these, Oliver T. Morton, in an interview at Indianapolis, "
stated that Judge Gresham wished his name withdrawn as 
"a candidate in 1888, as soon as the platform was adopted, "
and then the young man proceeded to attack the editors 
by name. To but one of the critics did Judge Gresham 
make any answer. It was to Joseph Medill of the Chicago 
Tribune. 

"HON. JOSEPH MEDILL, November 7, 1892. "

MY DEAR SIR: 

"I recognize the address on an envelope just received, contain "
"ing an editorial from the Inter-Ocean of the 4th inst., as your "
handwriting. I am not disturbed by what Mr. Nixon has said. 
It is not true that I was ever a frequent visitor at his office. Al 
"though your criticism was not just, it did not offend me. I can "
understand that in your situation you felt obliged to give me a 



676 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

lick. I assure you that I shall ever feel grateful to you for the 
past. I regret that Mr. Morton mentioned your name in his 
interview at Indianapolis last Saturday. 

After my interview with you at my chambers the day the 
"platform was adopted in 1888, I saw some of my friends at "
"the Palmer House and told them how I felt, what I thought of the "
"tariff plank, etc. I also told them what your view of the situation "
"w T as, and they all agreed with you. Mr. Morton was one of the "
gentlemen then present. It is true that nothing but fear that I 
would embarrass you and other friends prevented me from send 
"ing a letter to the convention, withdrawing my name as candidate. "
"I never did believe in high tariff or the McKinley Bill, and I told "
a number of my friends that I would not vote the ticket again 
if the party adhered to its then platform. Both you and Mr. 
Patterson know where I have stood on the tariff question. I have 
"not changed. I have no political ambition, but if I had, no one "
realizes better than I do that I have committed political suicide. 
Some people are unable to understand that a man can deliberately 
do that. 

"Faithfully yours, "

W. Q. GRESHAM. 

The next few months were pleasant. The only dis 
turbing fact was the talk of a panic which had been pre 
dicted and prepared for by many financiers and business men 
ever since the passage of the Sherman Silver Act providing 
"for the coinage of 800,000 ounces of silver monthly on the "
basis of about fifty cents on the dollar. But instead of 
"putting out the coin, $i, $2, $5, and $10 certificates were "
issued against it. Banks were hoarding gold. As Samuel 
"W. Allerton, one of our neighbors, said, ""The money sharks "
and the Jews are using the silver certificates to jerk the 
"gold out of her. Soon she will be busted."" ""She"" was the "
"United States Treasury. Illiterate, but very intelligent "
"and a very rich man, Samuel W. Allerton had changed his "
views about Walter Q. Gresham being an unsafe man. 
"Soon we will be on a silver basis, he said. On presen "
tation and demand the Treasurer of the United States 



SECRETARY OF STATE 677 

"and the Assistant Treasurers in New York, Chicago, and "
San Francisco would redeem the silver certificates in gold. 
Nelson Morris was a co-director with Mr. Allerton in the 
"First National Bank of Chicago. ""Of course,"" said Mr. "
"Allerton, ""Nels will swap a silver dollar for a gold one "
"every day in the week, especially when the silver dollar is "
"worth only 50 cents."" But it was at the Sub-Treasury "
in New York that the greatest swapping was done. The 
"Jews without a country, for not all of that race who were "
"living in New York were naturalized, are not to be censured "
for taking advantage of the situation. And the Jews were 
"not the only men who ""jerked the gold out of her."" The "
responsibility was on the men who created the system. On 
"the other hand, there were Jews like Nathan Strauss who "
arose to the best level of American citizenship. While the 
silver certificates and greenbacks were being used to de 
"plete the Treasury of gold, powerful pressure was brought "
from financial centers on the administration to induce it 
to preserve the gold standard. Secretary of the Treasury 
Foster had prepared the plates for the purpose of printing 
the bonds with which to buy the gold to preserve the 
"integrity of the government, when President Harrison put "
his foot down and arbitrarily said he would not consent to 
the issue of any bonds for that or for any other purpose 
during his administration. All that President Harrison 
could do was to postpone for a while the storm that the 
legislation he had consented to was bound to produce. 

"Norman B. Ream ""Farmer Ream,"" he was called - "
"one of President Harrison s ""kitchen cabinet"" in Chicago, "
brought us this word. Mr. Ream owned immense tracts 
of corn land in Illinois; he was a successful board of trade 
"operator, was in all kinds of enterprises, and owned a great "
deal of property. He was the ablest and best poised of 
all the big men who had made Chicago in a commercial 
"and industrial way. A Pennsylvanian by birth, a veteran "
"of the Civil War, and, of course, a Protectionist of the "



678 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"extreme school, he did not believe in such laws as the "
"Sherman Anti-Trust Act and, under the advice of counsel, "
sailed in the teeth of them. And the lawyer who merely 
listened and was ready to put through what Norman B. 
Ream wanted done was the best lawyer. Mr. Ream put 
his house in order soon after the passage of the Sherman 
Silver Act and then went to selling almost everything 
"short. He died in New York, one of the strong men in "
"Wall Street, possessed of immense wealth. Simple in "
"manner, never purse proud, Norman B. Ream possessed a "
facility of expression never surpassed. 

"I had heard J. W. Doane, president of the Merchants "
"Loan and Trust Company, and V. T. Malott, the Indian "
"apolis banker, discuss the financial situation. Mr. Malott "
was the receiver of the Chicago &amp; Atlantic Railroad. Night 
"after night, while the Sherman Silver Act in 1890 was before "
"Congress, I heard Mr. Malott discuss it. He quoted the "
"Gresham Law, that the inferior money always drives "
"out the good, and as a banker he predicted that, if the "
"Sherman Bill passed, it would only be a question of time "
until we would be on a silver basis. 

"And then there was General Benjamin H. Bristow, who "
had been Secretary of the Treasury in General Grant s 
second administration. He discussed the situation over 
and over again. General Bristow understood the financial 
"question, and he said his clients in New York and the "
speculators had long been getting ready for the coming 
panic. 

But none of the responsibility and blame seemed on 
"us, and besides, I thought we were through with politics "
"forever, so I was happy. Suddenly I was aroused to the "
real situation by the receipt of a letter from Mr. Cleveland 
offering my husband the position of Secretary of State. 
The offer came in the form of a letter from Mr. Cleveland 
and a telegram from Don M. Dickinson. Both were 
received on the same day and at about the same hour. 



SECRETARY OF STATE 679 

"LAKEWOOD, N. J., Jan. 25, 1893. "
"HON. WALTER Q. GRESHAM, "

MY DEAR SIR: 

Will you accept the place of Secretary of State in coming 
administration? 

You will doubtless be surprised by this proposition but I 
hope you may see your way clear to accede to my request. 

You know enough of cabinet duties to make it unnecessary 
for me to enlarge upon their character or scope. 

I fear that your sensitiveness concerning the view that may 
be taken of your acceptance of the position in connection with 
your prior political affiliations and the part you took in the late 
"campaign, may cause you to shrink from a fair consideration on "
this subject. 

"I beg you, however, to believe that your sturdy regard for "
"political duty and your supreme sincerity and disinterestedness, "
"seen and known of all men, are proof against any and all unworthy "
suspicions or malicious criticism. 

"In really a great emergency, the country needs your services "
in the place I ask you to fill. In an effort to subserve the interests 
"of my countrymen, I need you. "

"Can you not come to us? Hoping for an early reply, I am, "
"Yours very sincerely, "

GROVER CLEVELAND. 

"NEW Y^ORK, January 27, 1893. "
"HON. WALTER Q. GRESHAM, "
UNITED STATES COURTS. 

"Confidential. Please wait, I will arrive to-morrow evening. "
Leaving here on Limited at four-thirty to-day. Please send word 
to Hotel Richelieu when I can see you. Your house to-morrow 
evening or Sunday. 

DON M. DICKINSON. 

I was opposed to my husband s accepting Mr. Cleve 
"land s offer. My home was pleasant, my children and "
"grandchildren were about me, and I felt that the acceptance "
of the office tendered could add nothing to my husband s 
"fame. He was well and strong, and I had not for many "



68o LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

years felt so free from cares that had been mine since the 
beginning of the War of the Rebellion. My son joined 
me in this view. We were not without full faith in Mr. 
Cleveland s integrity and patriotism. Our reasons were 
perhaps not entirely unselfish. My husband s personal pop 
"ularity, which Frank Hatton said was greater than that "
"of Mr. Elaine, we did not want him to sacrifice. His mo "
tives would be misjudged and he would be maligned. We 
pressed home the objection that the panic then actually 
"on, although not apparent to many, was gaining momentum "
and would soon break and be charged up to the men who 
"must stem it and remove its causes, so far as they could "
be removed by governmental agency. 

Don M. Dickinson spent at our house the Sunday he 
mentioned in his telegram. I made it as plain to him as 
"I could by my manner and general conversation, while "
"treating him with courtesy, that he was not a welcome "
"visitor, bearing the message which I knew he had to deliver. "
"He knew that I was opposing him, but I left him to my "
husband. Mr. Dickinson said to me when I met him next 
"in Washington, ""You were the coldest woman I had ever "
met when I saw you in Chicago. You tried to freeze me 
"out, and you largely succeeded. You disturbed me greatly "
and you almost defeated us. I cannot now realize how you 
"can be so agreeable."" I answered him, ""I always try to "
"make the best of any situation."" That evening he sent "
me a large bunch of roses. The next letter shows that at 
first I triumphed over Mr. Dickinson and that Mr. Cleve 
land s offer was declined: 

"CHICAGO, February 3, 1893. "
"HON. GROVER CLEVELAND, "
MY DEAR SIR: 

We are in accord on political questions. Our ideas of public 
"duty are the same, and I feel that I would enjoy close association "
"with you. There are demands upon me, however, besides those "
"of my own household, which I feel I could not properly meet "



SECRETARY OF STATE 68 1 

should I go to Washington on your invitation; and realizing your 
"situation, and fearing that my delay has already embarrassed "
"you, I decline the proffered honor. I regret this not because I "
am ambitious to hold a high office but because I admire your 
"character, appreciate your patriotic motives, and would like to "
oblige you. 

I cannot adequately express the satisfaction it affords me to 
"know that I possess your confidence, and I beg to say that I shall "
ever cherish for you sentiments of the highest esteem and sincere 
friendship. 

"Your countrymen do not doubt your ability, honesty, and "
"courage, and they will not desert you in your patriotic efforts to "
promote their welfare. 

"You have paid me an undeserved compliment, but I appre "
ciate it nevertheless. 

"Faithfully yours, "

W. Q. GRESHAM. 

Mr. Dickinson returned to New York and there were 
"telegrams from Daniel S. Lamont, George Hoadly, Charles "
"S. Fairchild, W. C. Whitney, John G. Carlisle, and other "
"friends of Mr. Cleveland, urging Mr. Gresham to accept. "
I will quote but one: 

"NEW YORK, February 3, 1893. "
HON. WALTER O. GRESHAM: 

"I know well your feelings, but I think you owe a duty to Mr. "
Cleveland and to the country. Your motives have not been 
and will not now be questioned or doubted by the mass of your 
countrymen. It has been well known everywhere for years that 
upon the issues now dividing the parties you belong to Mr. Cleve 
land s side. You should respect his wish. Nothing but the 
impending shadow of a terrible personal bereavement disqualify 
ing me for any good work has stopped me from carrying on the 
fight with him. You are strong and represent a large class who 
have not heretofore stood with our party. Do not let anything 
small in other minds influence you to turn back from a great call 

to duty. 

W. C. WHITNEY. 



682 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"And then came Colonel Henry Watterson, who had "
heard of the offer. He did not come as an emissary of 
"Mr. Cleveland, for the world knows that at that time Mr. "
Cleveland and Colonel Watterson were not personal friends. 
It was Mr. Watterson s influence and appeals that moved 
my husband finally to accept Cleveland s offer. What 
ever may have been Mr. Watterson s and Mr. Cleve 
"land s differences, no man has ever more carefully guarded "
Cleveland s personal and political integrity than Henry 
"Watterson. There was nothing little and mean in ""Marse "
"Henry."" "

In response to one question my husband asked Wat 
"terson, if he could support the incoming administration "
with Cleveland at its head and Gresham as Secretary 
"of State, Watterson promptly replied that he not only "
"could, but would, and "" under the circumstances, it is your "
"duty to accept."" Most heartily and cordially was this "
"pledge kept, even to the extent of supporting the Hawaiian "
policy. 

The day Mr. Watterson came up from Louisville and 
"made his plea, the offer was renewed in the following "
telegram : 

"LAKEWOOD, N. J., February 6, 1893. "
To HON. WALTER Q. GRESHAM: 

Every consideration of my duty and personal inclination 
constrains me to ask a reconsideration of the subject referred to 
in your letter.

"HON. GROVER CLEVELAND, "

I think you understand me and I believe I understand you. 
"I have no doubt that you feel that you need me in your cabinet, "
and I have finally concluded to yield to your wish and judgment. 
"I still entertain misgivings, however, as to the wisdom of the step, "
but I hope that neither of us will ever have cause to regret it. I

"desire that you shall feel perfectly free, even up to the last moment, "
to substitute some one else in my place should circumstances 
seem to require it. 

Our Circuit Court of Appeals will adjourn Saturday of this 
"week, after which we will need some time to examine and decide "
the submitted cases. And that is not all. I have on my table 
a number of important equity cases which should be disposed 
of before I leave the bench. What shall I do? Can you allow 
me to remain here a few days after the 4th of March? I will 
"exert myself to finish my work before then. Of course, I under "
stand that it may be necessary for me to see you before you go 
to Washington. 

"Sincerely yours, "

W. Q. GRESHAM. 



"LAKE WOOD, N. J., February 9, 1893. "
"HON. WALTER Q. GRESHAM, "
MY DEAR SIR: 

Your letter of the yth instant came to hand two or three 
"hours ago, and causes me the greatest satisfaction. I know per "
fectly well that only considerations of patriotism and duty have 
"constrained you to accede to my wishes, and I assure you this "
vastly increases my appreciation of what you have done. Do 
you not think I or you had better in a matter-of-fact and unsen- 
sational way give the fact to the public that you have accepted 
"the place? If you deem it best that I give it out, I wish you "
"would simply send me a dispatch of some sort to that effect, put "
in a way that no one needs to understand it but me. 

"Ordinarily, of course, the names of the cabinet officers would "
go to the Senate and be confirmed March 5. If you could con 
"tinue to act as a judge after confirmation, matters can take the "
usual course and the State Department be left in the hands of 
"those at present in charge, until you are ready to take possession; "
"otherwise, your name need not be sent in and confirmed until "
"your judicial work is done. Of course, conditions exist which "
"may render it desirable that you assume charge as soon as possible, "
but this must yield to your desire and convenience or to the 
duties of your present position. 



684 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN ORE SHAM 

Mr. Carlisle writes me that Senator Morgan would be glad 
"to see me or my Secretary of State, before he leaves for Paris to "
"attend the Bering Sea arbitration; unless you desire to see him, "
I do not S2e why your work should be interrupted for that purpose. 
Perhaps I can ask Carlisle to see him or see him myself. 

I would certainly be exceedingly glad to have a chat with you 
between now and the 4th of March and hope that your work 
will so clear up as to enable you to come to see me. 

"I have settled, I think, on five members of the cabinet. I "
"mean to have Carlisle for the Treasury, Lamont for War, Bissell "

representative of the new and progressive South) for Interior. 
"This leaves the Navy, Attorney-General, and Agriculture still "
"to be selected. I want George Gray, Senator from Delaware, to "
"accept the Attorney-General s place, but he has thus far, strangely "
"enough, declined. If there was a first-rate man in Alabama, "
"Mississippi, or that neighborhood, I would like to consider him. "
"If not, I am prepared to take a man from almost any quarter. "

"I offered Agriculture to Boies of Iowa, but he and his friends "
are reckoning on his making a successful canvass for United 
States Senator next fall and he declined my invitation. The 
"Navy ought not to be a very hard place to nil, but I have not "
just the man in my view yet. It is barely possible that I may 
"induce Senator Gray to take the Attorney-Generalship after all, "
but I hardly expect it. 

I would be very glad to receive any suggestions you may make 
concerning incumbents for these various places. Now that I 
"have secured the head of my Cabinet, I feel that it should be "
completed as soon as possible. 

"If your leisure and convenience permit, I hope you will write "
me. Please address me by letter or dispatch at this place. 

Very sincerely yours. 

GROVER CLEVELAND. 

"Ten days later, or to be exact, on the 226., there "
was a conference at Lakewood between Mr. Cleveland 
and Seeretaries-to-be Gresham and Carlisle. At this 
conference there was considered the case of the Hawaiian 



SECRETARY OF STATE 685 

"Queen, the Bering Sea Arbitration, and the impending "
panic. It was agreed that whatever measures were neces 
sary to protect the public credit would be taken. The 
Harrison administration s refusal to issue bonds to keep 
the requisite amount of gold in the Treasury would not 
be followed. 

The independent press unanimously approved the an 
nouncement that Judge Gresham would be made Secretary 
of State in the incoming administration. Many of the 
"People s party men approved it, and none criticized. At "
"Indianapolis, John H. Holliday, no longer of the Indian "
"apolis News, and his successors in that paper, Delavan "
"Smith, William Henry Smith, Charles R. Williams, and "
"Morris Ross, gave it their unqualified indorsement. And "
so did Federal Judge John H. Baker of Indianapolis. It 
is not to be denied that there was some Democratic mur 
muring. Still the announcement was remarkably well 
received considering the circumstances. William H. Eng 
"lish wrote that the Indiana Democrats, with one single "
"exception, approved it, and ""that man will keep still."" "
From the old Democratic opponent in the Indiana legisla 
"ture in 1 86 1, John H. Stotsenburgh and Mrs. Stotsenburgh "
"of New Albany, came cordial greetings. Samuel E. Morse, "
"the Indianapolis editor, had urged Judge Gresham to take "
"the People s party nomination. He and Thomas Taggart, "
who had conducted the Indiana campaign as chairman 
"of the State Committee, were cordial in their welcome, "
"as they put it, to the Democratic party. They had "
pressed Mr. Cleveland s nomination against the opposi 
tion of Senators Voorhees and Turpie. Both the latter 
applauded the appointment. Senator Voorhees said in a 
"public interview, ""It was the best that could be made "
"between ocean and ocean."" Congressman W. D. Bynum "
and Jason B. Brown of Indiana were equally strong in 
their expressions. 

"Henry Watterson, of course, gave it his public approval. "



686 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"In an editorial and cartoon in his paper, he said, ""He that "
"is last shall be first, and he that is first shall be last."" And "
William C. Whitney wrote his approval. 

Senator John M. Palmer of Illinois and William H. 
"Morrison- ""Horizontal Bill,"" as he was called then on "
the Interstate Commerce Commission both resented the 
announcement. They were both personal friends of my 
husband. Subsequently they gave him their most hearty 
"support, especially General Palmer in the Senate. Senator "
"Yilas of Wisconsin remained mute, while Wall, the member "
"of the National Committee from Wisconsin, openly criti "
"cized, and then recanted and wrote my husband a letter in "
which he said he had been mistaken. 

"But from ""the boys in the trenches"" the letters and "
telegrams of approval came by the basketful. 

"One from Luther W. Abel from St. Louis, late first "
"sergeant, Company H, Twenty-third Indiana Volunteers, "
"who had refused, as he wrote, to re-enlist at Hebron, Mis "
"sissippi, in February, 1864, and as a consequence, on the "
"order of General Gresham, had been reduced to the ranks, "
"the worst disgrace ever put on me, illustrates the pres "
sure that was used to get veterans for Sherman s army 
"for the Atlanta campaign, and the cordiality of our greet "
ing. I quote the following from Sergeant Abel s letter: 

"As I was always a Democrat before and after the war, I made "
"up my mind to get even with you, and when you and Kerr run "
"for Congress in Indiana, I worked day and night against you, "
using the two orders against you that you sent me at Camp 
"Hebron; and I tell you, the} did execution and you were downed "
with a very nice majority and I got even with you. 

"Now, General Gresham, I never was more surprised in my "
life when I read the news stating you had turned over to Dem 
ocracy. All the enmity I felt against you for your treatment of 
"me left me and I felt joys toward you instead of malice, arid as "
you are appointed to the highest and most honorable position in 
"President Cle\ T eland s cabinet, I am proud to congratulate you. "



SECRETARY OF STATE 687 

"The cordiality with which my husband, and even I "
"myself, was received by the leading Democrats, disproves "
"the criticism that my husband s appointment, and his ac "
ceptance of the office of Secretary of State was a politi 
"cal mistake. Senator Murphy, the Tammany Senator from "
"New York, who, of course, was a hard money man, before "
we had been in Washington six months said that my hus 
band was his choice for President in 1896. Most of the 
Southern Democrats took that view and practically all of 
the Indiana Democrats. Senator Voorhees made no con 
cealment of his views and neither did Thomas Taggart. 

"I mention this, not that my husband had any ambitions "
"in this direction, for he knew that his health and age would "
"preclude such a course when the time should arrive, but "
simply to show that he was able to sustain those relations 
of intimacy and friendship that are essential to enable a 
man to accomplish much for good in public life. And 
these relations enabled him to perform his part in help 
ing to repeal legislation that produced the panic which the 
Republicans had brought upon the nation. 

On his way to the conference with Mr. Cleveland and 
"Mr. Carlisle at Lakewood, Judge Gresham did not see Sen "
"ator Morgan, as he had already sailed for Paris to attend "
"the Bering Sea Arbitration. And so far as I know, Sena "
"tor Morgan was the only Southern man, barring Senator "
Gorman of Maryland (and I did not regard him exactly as 
"a Southern man), in either Senate or the House who did "
not receive us with a cordiality that could not have been 
assumed. 

"Indeed, the relations my husband sustained with Henry "
Watterson and with the Southern men became a source of 
"jealousy, it was said, on Cleveland s part. "

OPENS WORLD S FAIR. 

1\ /TY husband started alone to Washington on the even- 
"-LVX. ing of the 3d of March, timing his arrival after the "
inaugural ceremonies were over. Soon he wrote me that 
"he had plenty of work, but as the questions were all legal, "
"they were easy. About two weeks later, with my son, I "
went on to join him. The warmth of his reception had 
made him most happy. 

Henry Watterson had attended the inauguration with 
"a crowd of his extreme Southern followers, who had unani "
mously approved his judgment in bringing into their fold 
"his Northern friend --""the best Democrat in the adminis "
"tration."" Still, I had my misgivings. "

"I had never met Mr. Cleveland up to that time, but had "
"met Mrs. Cleveland in 1886, when she was with Mr. Cleve "
land in his swing around the circle. The evening of the 
day of our arrival at the Arlington Hotel Secretary Lament 
called and announced that I should call on Mr. and Mrs. 
"Cleveland that evening. My husband, Secretary Lamont, "
and I walked from the hotel to the White House. We 
were received upstairs in the library. Mrs. Cleveland was 
in an ordinary day dress and Mr. Cleveland wore a business 

688



CLEVELANDS SECOND ADMINISTRATION 689 

suit. We made quite a long call. I watched Mr. Cleve 
land very closely. He was fat and had a squeaky voice. 
"Why his voice was squeaky on this occasion, I did not then "
"know, for afterwards it always seemed strong and resonant. "
"Mr. Cleveland did not appear at his best, and I must con "
fess I was disappointed at this time in him. Mr. Lament 
"must have read my face, for as we walked back to the "
"hotel, when we were opposite the old Blaine house, he said, "
You will like him better: he will appear better when you 
"know him well."" "

Mr. Lament was right. I came to know Mr. Cleve 
land better and liked him better. He was always kind 
and considerate and most confidential. I sat at his side 
"at all State functions, many of which were stupid be "
cause official etiquette required the seating of guests ac 
cording to prescribed rules. On these occasions we had 
to talk and usually there was no restraint. Guarded 
and careful as I was with newspaper men and women 
strangers and with designing people that a woman s 
"intuition always detected, with intimates I could discuss "
even affairs of State. My freedom in expressing myself 
"early in the administration to Mr. Cleveland, Secretary "
"Carlisle, and my husband took the fancy of both Cleve "
"land and Carlisle, and only earned a mild rebuke from my "
"husband. Besides, I was always considerate and made the "
proper advances to the green and awkward at the White 
House. I had done that all my life. With a strong man 
"back of me during the War, I had seen that a kind word "
from even a small woman w r as appreciated. Early in the 
Arthur administration I had learned w r hat an aid a cabinet 
woman could be to the head of the administration by being 
considerate to a woman who was not accustomed to the 
"ways of Washington official society, if you please, but, "
"possessing character and refinement, would in a short time "
be thoroughly at home. Possibly her husband was a man 
of power and influence. If Mr. Cleveland was wanting 



690 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"in tact, as his critics claimed, he could appreciate it in "
others. 

"While it did not come up at the beginning, it did very "
"soon after, and it is proper at this point to mention the "
"fact that, notwithstanding that the succession is, and was "
"then, to the Secretary of State after the Vice-President, "
Mr. Cleveland gave the ambassadors precedence in all 
social matters over the Secretary of State. The law had 
but recently been passed raising the rank of minister to 
"Great Britain and France to that of ambassador, and it "
devolved on Mr. Cleveland to make the precedent. Sir 
"Julian Pauncefote, the English minister, I know thought "
Mr. Cleveland was wrong. But it was a matter of indiffer 
"ence to my husband. For instance, I sat at Mr. Cleveland s "
left and Lady Pauncefote at his right at State dinners. 
Because my husband was indifferent to some of the forms of 
"official life, he was written down as no diplomat. And the "
"same people, when rebuked for presuming, were more pro "
nounced than ever in their opinion. 

"Early in the administration, I well remember a day "
"spent at Woodley, where the Clevelands had gone for the "
Spring. Secretary Gresham had been called out by the 
"President to consult over State matters, and I went along to "
get better acquainted with Mrs. Cleveland. I sat waiting 
"in the drawing room for some time, when a maid carne in "
"and said, ""Mrs. Cleveland says, will you please walk up "
"stairs."" I was shown into a living room or nursery, and "
there was Mrs. Cleveland down on the floor cutting a baby 
"sack out of a remnant. She said, ""I have just got it, and "
"must finish it before I get up."" "

We chatted through the morning. Towards noon I grew 
"restless, but still Mr. Cleveland and my husband were "
"engaged. We heard nothing from the library, and finally "
"lunch w r as announced. This ended the conference of State, "
"and it was insisted that we remain to lunch, which we did. "
It was as simple as any one could find in any well-to-do 



CLEVELAND S SECOND ADMINISTRATION 691 

American home. Many were the informal meals we after 
"wards took at Woodley, and, all reports to the contrary, "
Mr. Cleveland was most frugal in his eating and drinking. 
"Because he was subject to the gout, an infirmity I too had "
"inherited from my ancestors, Mr. Cleveland was interdicted "
"from the use of wine, and Mrs. Cleveland was inflexible in en "
forcing the rule. Many a time did I aid him with just one 
glass of champagne in escaping Mrs. Cleveland s vigilance. 
"Outside of regular official entertainments, the Clevelands "
did very little entertaining. With what the government 
"supplied to run the White House, a President could very "
easily in Mr. Cleveland s time do all that was required in 
the way of official entertaining and save half of his salary. 
That Mr. Cleveland left the White House better off than 
when he entered it the last time is explained by his 
economy and by Secretary Lament s management of his 
private affairs. That Lament speculated for Cleveland is 
absurd. He simply looked after Mr. Cleveland s private 
property as he did his political interests. Lamont made 
subscriptions on Mr. Cleveland s account to all charities 
that a President should meet. 

"Mr. Cleveland was not ""bookish"" and did not pretend "
to be a well-read man. He told me Mrs. Cleveland read 
American history to him at night. In no sense was Mrs. 
"Cleveland a society or a ""new"" woman. She was purely "
domestic in her tastes. She was a good mother and she 
loved babies. 

I found many old friends in Washington. Among them 
"was Mrs. Carlisle, wife of the Secretary of the Treasury. "
"I had known her during the Arthur administration, when "
her husband was Speaker of the House. She was a remark 
"able woman, possessed of great ability and aptitude for all "
"kinds of life. She was also a warm, disinterested friend. "
She was the best friend I ever had in Washington. 

One day Mrs. Carlisle and I called on Mrs. Cleveland 
about a meeting of the ladies of the cabinet. Such meetings 



692 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"are always held, and when there is a lady in the White House, "
"they are held there. Much to Mrs. Carlisle s amusement, "
Mrs. Cleveland entertained us during the entire visit by 
letting us watch her wash the baby. Her devotion to her 
"children and to her domestic life, which no one can criticize, "
prevented her from associating with the wives of Congress 
"men and others, who for this reason drew the inference that "
she was reserved and distant. Had Mrs. Cleveland been 
"free to exercise the tact she possessed, she could have molli "
fied much of the resentment that grew up against her hus 
"band. This, I believe, is the limit of a woman s functions "
in politics. Nature never intended that she should vote 
and march behind a brass band. The question of woman s 
suffrage did not become a practical one in my husband s 
lifetime. But in aiding the individual woman no man ever 
"went farther than he, as witness the Angle case and the "
case of the Hawaiian Queen. 

Postmaster-General Bissell came to my husband with 
much of his department business. Secretary Lamont did 
"the same, and told me that he never called on my husband "
for information and advice but that he got what he went 
after. Comptroller Eckels night after night came to Mr. 
Gresham for advice. He had been a country lawyer and 
a great friend of Mr. Cleveland before he was appointed 
Comptroller of the Currency. He was a much overrated 
man. He was steered right by Mr. Cleveland and by Mr. 
"Gresham, and got the credit for acts which were based "
on the advice of others. Secretary Smith and Secretary 
Carlisle were frequent visitors and sought the views of my 
husband on many occasions on the questions which came 
up in their departments. 

General B. H. Bristow and Mrs. Bristow of New York 
were temporarily keeping house in Washington and we saw 
much of them. General Bristow was a friend of Mr. 
Cleveland s as well as of my husband. He was thoroughly 
familiar with the financial legislation of the country and 



CLEVELANDS SECOND ADMINISTRATION 693 

"the business situation in New York, and both Secretary "
Gresham and Mr. Cleveland discussed the situation with 
him. He bantered my husband a good deal about being 
"a Democrat, and sometimes showed annoyance when my "
"husband said: ""You voted for Cleveland in 1884 but did "
"not show your colors."" "

"Soon after we reached Washington, at the British Em "
"bassy I met Mrs. William E. Chandler and her husband, "
who was then in the Senate. Mrs. Chandler was so cordial 
in her greetings that it caused comment until it was learned 
that we had been neighbors and particular friends in 1883 
and 1884 during the Arthur administration. 

My second meeting with Mr. Cleveland was at the 
"dinner to the Infanta Eulalie, an aunt of the King of Spain, "
"Alphonso XIII. The dinner was not good, as I remember "
"it. The soup gave out, and among those who did not get "
any was Postmaster-General Bissell. The silver looked 
like plated ware that had been in use in a boarding house. 
Mrs. Cleveland afterwards had it melted and made smaller 
in size and into a greater number of pieces. At that time 
there was not silverware enough in the White House to set 
"a State dinner, and there was no contingent fund out of "
which additional silver could have been purchased. Not 
"withstanding this, Mrs. Cleveland s action in having it "
"melted was much criticized, as the silver had been bought "
during a great many different administrations and some of 
it had been in the White House for many years. 

It had been arranged by the previous administration 
to bring the Infanta Eulalie and the Duke de Veragua 
to the World s Columbian Exposition as our nation s 
guests. The Duke de Veragua was a lineal descendant of 
Christopher Columbus. A member of royalty cannot be 
entertained in a republic without embarrassment to both 
"parties. The invitation having been extended, it could "
not be withdrawn. When the Spanish minister represent 
ed that the Infanta demanded that a furnished house with 



694 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

a full retinue of servants be put at her disposal in both 
"Washington and Chicago, the answer given the minister "
was that ample accommodations would be provided in 
the hotels. There was surprise in the inner circles of 
the administration when the minister announced that Her 
Highness would come at the appointed time. 

She and her suite were met at the station by the Secre 
tary of State and conducted to the Arlington Hotel. The 
next day Her Highness and the Spanish minister were 
taken by the Secretary of State to the White House and 
presented to President Cleveland. Mr. Cleveland did not 
return the call. At this Her Highness and the Spanish 
"minister took great offense, which the people of Chicago "
thought should not have been vented on them. Among 
other outings that had been planned for her was a trip to 
"Mount Vernon, which took place after the trip to Chicago. "
I was sent along as the representative of the administra 
"tion. We went down the river and back on the Dauphin. "" "
I had much conversation with Her Highness. She said 
among other things that she always wanted to come to 
"the United States, where women were so free and had "
"such a good time. She was a flirty, frivolous woman, not "
the kind that would ever have attained the freedom some 
"American women know so well how to enjoy, but which "
may be abused if society passes into the hands of some of 
our latter-day sisters. 

The Duke de Veragua and the Infanta Eulalie visited 
the World s Fair under the auspices of the State Depart 
ment. But Her Highness would not meet the Duke. She 
"and her suite consumed an extraordinary amount of beer, "
"cognac, cigarettes, and champagne during the visit to Chi "
cago. Consternation and horror reigned in the Board of 
"Lady Managers, when they learned that the newspaper "
men were on the point of telegraphing it broadcast over the 
"country that the cause of Her Highness conduct, at least "
"at one reception, was that she was under the influence of "



CLEVELAND S SECOND ADMINISTRATION 695 

"liquor. But the newspaper men were complaisant, and "
"suppressed, as they often have, a good story. Still there "
was wide publicity. 

"The Board of Lady Managers of the World s Fair, of "
"which Mrs. Potter Palmer was the head, had many func "
tions for the Spanish guest. Mrs. Palmer s jewels so far 
outshone those of the Infanta that the latter told a few 
friends in confidence they were glass. Such confidences 
"are always soon broadcast, as they are often intended to "
"be, and the result was that there was a great commotion "
in the Board of Lady Managers and among the Chicago 
society women who wore their most beautiful toilettes and 
had irreproachable manners. At receptions Her Highness 
insisted on receiving the guests sitting; not even to the 
Vice-President of the United States would she rise and 
give her hand. At some of the functions she even refused 
"to meet the guests. She accepted invitations, and at the "
"last minute, without excuse or apology, broke them. "

The visit of the Infanta Eulalie did the cause of poor 
old Spain much harm in America. One of the ladies 
whose position clothed her with the responsibility of hostess 
"to Her Highness, concluded her account to the Secretary "
of State: 

Of course no one knows why Congress invited this represen 
"tative of a queen to our country, and neither do we know why she "
accepted the invitation. It would seem that there must have 
"been some idea on foot of doing her honor, and on her part of "
"receiving attentions in a proper spirit, and cementing the bond of "
good feeling between the two countries. I think it rather for 
"tunate that we are to have no more royal personages, for I feel "
sure that neither the press nor the people could succeed another 
time in smothering their feelings in case they were outraged. 

The Secretary of State made no secret of his relief when 
Her Highness sailed for home. The Duke de Veragua so en 
joyed American hospitality and was so impervious to all 
"hints that he was overstaying his invitation, that finally "



696 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"Secretary of State Gresham wrote the naval officer, Com "
"modore Davis, who had him in charge, to take him to New "
York and bid him good-bye. 

"Sir Julian Pauncefote, the English ambassador, had "
"been educated for the bar. His legal education, he said, "
was a great aid in his diplomatic work. A mastery of the 
details of the practice and the principles of jurisprudence 
as applied in the courts for years and corrected by Parlia 
"ment, had made plain, he said, that the great question of "
"the age was the economic one, that of capital and labor, "
and it was so recognized by his government. It was to be 
"solved on principles of righteousness and justice, and the "
same was becoming truer every day of international prob 
lems. In this he and Walter Q. Gresham were in accord 
at the start. 

"Early in the administration, as I have before stated, at "
the same time the British and French governments raised 
"their ministers to ambassadors to the United States, great "
"rivalry ensued between Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British "
"minister, and M. Jusserand, the French minister, as to who "
"should become the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps, which "
depended on who was first recognized by our government 
as ambassador. My husband took the lead in recognizing 
"Sir Julian first, and in raising Mr. Bayard, our minister to "
"Great Britain, to the rank of ambassador. M. Jusserand "
"was very much disappointed and sulked like a boy, but "
after a time suppressed his disappointment and acted the 
diplomat. Madame Jusserand never could conceal her dis 
appointment. She was the daughter of a very rich resi 
dent of Georgetown who had made his money publishing 
the New York Ledger. Lady Pauncefote and the Misses 
"Pauncefote were very agreeable, and our relations with all "
were particularly intimate. Notwithstanding that Mr. 
"Cleveland put Lady Pauncefote on his right, he did much "
"more talking to me than he did to her, and I was much "
freer in giving him my views than was the staid English 



CLEVELAND S SECOND ADMINISTRATION 697 

woman. But our positions were different. I was at home 
and she was abroad. 

"With all diplomats our relations, of course, were cordial. "
Especially were we on intimate terms with Prince Cantacu- 
"zene, the Russian minister. Walter Q. Gresham, at his "
"first meeting with the prince, acknowledged our indebted "
ness to Russia for the aid his government had rendered us 
during the War of the Rebellion. With all the representa 
tives of the South American republics we were intimate. 
"The Mexican minister, M. Romero, and M. Mendonca, "
"the Brazilian minister, were among my husband s special "
friends. He regarded them as men of exceptional ability. 
But it was not so with all the diplomats. The telegraph 
has made it easy for a man without much natural gift 
"to succeed in the diplomatic service, where years ago he "
could not. I never met a disagreeable woman among 
the families of the diplomats. But the same number of 
American women in their places would have been far 
better informed and more alert. The brightest woman 
"among them I ever knew was Madame De Struve, the "
wife of the Russian minister in Mr. Arthur s time. 

During the Arthur administration the wives of the 
members of the Chinese Embassy were never seen in 
public. We did not even meet them in private. I remem 
ber that we were shown the Chinese baby that was born 
"at the Chinese Embassy, but not the mother. "

The first wife of a representative of an Oriental nation 
to appear in public was Madame Yang-Yu. It was during 
the second Cleveland administration. She was the wife 
of the Chinese minister. When I first met her she felt 
"the contrast between our dresses and costumes, much it "
"seems to me, as I would have felt it had our places been "
reversed and I been in China. She manifested it by tak 
"ing my sleeve and saying, ""Pretty!"" one of the few "
English words she could utter. 



698 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

The duty devolved on me to introduce Madame Yang-Yu 
"to the public, as the Chinese minister had requested that I "
should do so. It was arranged that I should call on her and 
"take her, at an appointed time, to the White House to visit "
"Mrs. Cleveland. But when we started from the Embassy, "
"she asked to be driven around the city and to the Capitol, "
and to be shown the public buildings. It was not according 
"to orders, but I determined the Chinese woman should have "
her way. Accompanying her was an interpreter and her 
"little boy, a bright little fellow, eight or nine years of age. "
"She appeared in her Oriental costume, with all its bright "
"colors, and as we were in an open carriage and she was the "
"first Chinese woman to appear in public, we attracted a "
great deal of attention. The newsboys and gamins chased 
"us and yelled at us. They said, ""Hey, here s your China "
"woman!"" The Madame enjoyed it, the boys enjoyed it, "
and while it was not to my taste to be chased and hooted 
"at by the Washington urchins, I bore it until we had driven "
the town over. Then later I took her to the White House to 
see it and meet Mrs. Cleveland. She was very curious as 
"w r ell as bright, and examined our dresses and the furniture, "
"and was shown everything in the White House, from the "
kitchen to the garret. 

The first time Madame Yang-Yu attended a dinner out 
of the Embassy was at one of the diplomatic dinners given 
by my husband and myself. In the arrangement of the 
"seats, which was according to diplomatic etiquette, the Port "
uguese minister was assigned to take out to dinner the 
wife of the Chinese minister. This made him very indig 
nant. He protested and said that she might be one of 
several of the Chinese minister s wives. But he was told 
"he could not object on that ground, as we had no official or "
"unofficial advices that there was any other wife, or wives, "
than Madame Yang-Yu. 

"At the diplomatic dinner at the White House, following "
"this dinner, the Portuguese minister, much to his disgust, "



CLEVELAND SSECOND ADMINISTRATION 6gg 

was again seated beside Madame Yang-Yu. As she seemed 
to be having a quiet time of it and the minister still bore his 
"ill-tempered look, I caught her eye and raised my glass to "
"her. After the dinner she came to me, and we sat for a "
long time on the sofa in the East Room and talked as well 
as we could with my little Chinese and her not a little Eng 
"lish, and partly by signs. After a time some of the ladies "
came up and asked me what we were talking about. I told 
"them the Madame was commenting on the large amount, "
of material in their trains and the absence of it on their 
shoulders. 

Yang-Yu was an astute old fellow. In intellect he was 
the match for any of the diplomats. He came to see us 
"often. On one occasion he asked us about our Christ, and "
"then said, ""If only his followers are to be saved, how about "
"our Confucius and his followers?"" "

Before the Chinese- Japanese war and while we were 
"in Washington, Mr. Kurino, the Japanese minister, was "
"not accompanied by his wife. I saw a good deal of him, "
and my husband much more. 

It was the universal desire that the President and Mrs. 
Cleveland attend the World s Columbian Exposition. The 
Board of Lady Managers sent to Mrs. Cleveland a special 
"invitation, and it was a great disappointment to them and "
to the thousands of others who expected to see her that she 
"did not visit the Fair. Mr. Cleveland, Mr. and Mrs. Car "
"lisle, Secretary of the Interior Smith, Secretary of the Navy "
"Herbert and Miss Herbert, and ex-Secretary of State "
"Thomas F. Bayard and Mrs. Bayard, who were invited "
"at my husband s request, my husband s secretary, Ken-- "
"esaw M. Landis, my husband, and I made up the party "
which went to Chicago on a special car. 

At this time Mr. Bayard had been appointed ambas 
"sador to Great Britain, and it was his and my husband s de "
sire that he visit the World s Columbian Exposition before 
taking up his duties at the Court of St. James. In the 



700 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

convention that nominated Mr. Cleveland for the Presi 
"dency in 1884, Mr. Bayard had been a formidable candidate. "
Secretary of State during Mr. Cleveland s first adminis 
"tration, Mr. Bayard had been, with W. C. Whitney, an "
advocate of Mr. Cleveland s renomination in 1892. While 
in Mr. Arthur s cabinet my husband had become intimate 
with Mr. Bayard and had kept up that cordiality during 
"the intervening years, and most friendly and intimate were "
their relations while my husband was in the State Depart 
ment and Mr. Bayard at the Court of St. James. 

Mr. Cleveland spent several days in Chicago. We 
arrived at the city the Saturday before the Monday the 
"Fair was to be opened. Mr. Cleveland went to our church, "
"the Second Presbyterian, of which Dr. Simon J. McPherson "
"was pastor, and then accepted the invitation of my daugh "
"ter to attend the christening of her baby, Harriet Carle- "
ton Andrews. The afternoon was spent at our residence. 
There Mr. Cleveland was visited by a great many of our 
"neighbors, almost all of whom were Republicans who had "
depreciated my husband for voting for Mr. Cleveland. 
"Mr. Cleveland made himself most agreeable, and after "
wards many of them told me my husband had not made so 
great a mistake after all in voting for him. 

At the opening of the World s Fair Mr. Cleveland made 
"a short speech, in excellent taste, and it was well received, "
as he was. In a crowd he was a man who took with the 
people. They felt he was one of them. They trusted him. 
No one could view him in a crowd and fail to understand his 
"influence over people. Not only would they go to see him, "
but they would vote for him. The only man at the Fair 
"who could not get near him was the mayor of the city, the "
"elder Carter H. Harrison, who wanted to be United States "
Senator and desired to know how Illinois patronage was to 
be dispensed.

"T REMAINED behind to close up our home, so I did "
-* not go back to Washington with the Presidential 
party from the World s Fair. In Chicago I heard much 
"of the panic, which I knew was on before my husband "
"thought of becoming Secretary of State, and the existence "
of which was one of the reasons why I had urged him to 
decline Mr. Cleveland s offer. It was being fanned for 
political and financial reasons. 

"Mr. and Mrs. Potter Palmer, who had been insistent "
"on my husband s going into Cleveland s cabinet, had al "
ways been Democrats and were much concerned in a polit 
ical way. They were for the repeal of the Sherman Silver 
"Act. Potter Palmer, a practical man of affairs, was one "
of the ablest men I ever knew. He was born and reared 
"in western New York, and when as a very young man he "
started W^est with several thousand dollars it was pre 
dicted the youth and his money would soon part company. 
"Instead, the nest egg grew. He had all kinds of property, "
much of it in stocks and bonds. He founded and sold the 
business that made Marshall Field and L. Z. Leiter their 

701



702 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"fortunes, known to-day as Marshall Field &amp; Company. "
In the hotel business Potter Palmer increased his fortune. 
Borrowing three-quarters of a million to rebuild after the 
"fire, he was ready and offered to pay before the loan was "
due. So good was his credit that he had to pay interest 
until maturity. Mr. and Mrs. Palmer I believe were among 
my husband s best and most disinterested friends. They 
"had no notes payable in gold to meet, and owned no notes "
that were simply payable in money without specifying the 
"kind of money, so they were not influenced by any direct "
personal interests. In the event that the government 
"went on a silver basis, it would be difficult for people to "
get the gold to meet their obligations payable in that 
"medium, while, on the other hand, the creditor, except "
"when gold was specified, would have to be content with "
"silver; that is, he would have to be satisfied with about "
fifty-three cents on the dollar. A woman who thirty years 
"before, during the depression of the Civil War, had con "
"sidered hoarding a few gold dollars herself, could under "
stand how the big financial houses were then hoarding gold. 
"Woman-like, perhaps, I jumped to a conclusion too "
quickly. It was a panic that came from a former admin 
istration. The solution seemed easy to me. Let it come 
and get it over with. I went back to Washington in a 
couple of weeks. There the talk was of nothing but the 
"panic. The question was, Would the President call an "
extra session of Congress? The first morning after my 
return to Washington I went with my husband for a short 
ride. We stopped at the White House and there met 
Mr. Cleveland and Secretary Carlisle. They talked about 
an extra session of Congress. Cleveland said the barrier | 
"to that was Senator Voorhees, chairman of the Finance i "
"Committee of the Senate: ""He is unalterably committed "
"to silver."" There was a silence, and the freedom with ; "
"which Mr. Cleveland had imposed his confidence on me, "
"as it seemed to me, I suppose prompted the impulse, for I "



SILVER AND THE TARIFF 703 

"said: ""You gentlemen ought to be out more 4 among the "
people. The big panic that is coming you ean not now 
prevent. You can only postpone it. Let it come now; 
have it over with. The people will then see who is to 
blame. The Republican financial and tariff legislation 
"has brought it about. If you postpone it, the Republi "
"cans will say you brought it on."" Mr. Cleveland s eyes "
"twinkled, Mr. Carlisle looked at me approvingly, but my "
"husband said, ""Tillie, what do you know about such mat "
"ters?"" That was the expression he used when I got the "
"best of the argument which was seldom, I must confess. "
"Very well, I replied, ""I will go and see Mrs. Cleveland "
"and meet you at lunch."" "

"This was in May. Volney T. Malott, the Indianapolis "
"banker, had been in Washington in April, before this con "
versation took place. 

Mr. Malott had long been getting ready. His bank was 
well supplied with gold. Many other bankers w^ere also 
prepared for the emergency. They had supplied them 
selves with gold and were ready to make two for one the 
minute the country went on a silver basis. The gold in 
"the United States Treasury was down to $90,000,000. "
But Volney .T. Malott was an honest and patriotic man. 
"As a teller of a bank, he had been through the panic "
"of 1857, and he not only was familiar \vith the financial "
legislation of the country and with the bankers in the 
"large cities of the country, but also knew personally the "
bankers and business men of Indiana. He knew their 
relations to Senator Voorhees. He said Senator Voorhees 
would not be heedless to importunities that might come to 
him from his Democratic friends in banking and business 
enterprises in Indiana. He could name his men w r ith 
facility. The Secretary of State took Mr. Malott to the 
White House to repeat his statements to Mr. Cleveland. 

Mr. Malott strongly urged the calling of a special ses 
sion of Congress and the taking of every measure possible 
45



704 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

to preserve the integrity of the Treasury. To this Cleveland 
answered that the objection to calling an extra session of 
Congress was the chairman of the Financial Committee 
of the Senate. Mr. Malott told of the Democratic constit 
"uents of Senator Voorhees who would, if given the tip, "
implore the Senator to report a bill repealing a silver bill 
"for which he, Voorhees, did not vote. Still Mr. Cleveland "
thought Senator Voorhees could not be induced to consent 
to the repeal of the purchasing clause of the Sherman Silver 
"Act, and hesitated to call an extra session. "

With some of the Republican leaders inoculated with 
the free silver virus as they had been with the greenback 
"heresies, and with their disposition to play small politics, in "
which they were aided by those who were profiting unduly 
"by the tariff, it was a serious problem for a President who "
"was not in harmony, personally as well as politically, with "
the chairman of the Financial Committee of the Senate. 
There was a conference at the home of ex-Senator Thomas 
F. Bayard in Wilmington before he went to London as 
ambassador to Great Britain. The Secretary of State 
took with him a list of Senator Voorhees Indiana friends 
that Mr Malott had prepared. Mr. Bayard scanned them 
carefully. Of course he had known Senator Voorhees long 
and intimately. He believed Senator Voorhees would favor 
"the repeal of the Sherman Act, and was insistent that an "
"extra session be called ; but still Mr. Cleveland hung back, "

At this time there was in Washington a wealthy New 
York man by the name of Seth Barton French. He had 
been a business associate of J. P. Morgan. He had grown 
"children, and he had been a widower, but had married a "
"young wife. She was very fond of society, and her father "
desired a diplomatic position. Mr. French and General 
"Bristow were great friends, and in addition, their relations "
had been that of lawyer and client. 

"At the instance of the Secretary of State, General Bris "
tow asked Mr. French to get up a dinner party and invite 



SILVER AND THE TARIFF 705 

"Mr. and Mrs. Morgan. They came, and at the dinner I "
sat by Mr. Morgan s side. There was doubt as to how he 
"would line up, so he was an object of great curiosity to me. "
"He was uncommunicative, I soon discovered, and I feigned "
"ignorance of all questions oolitical, although I knew exactly "
what was going on. 

Mr. Morgan fell into line for the repeal of the Sherman 
Act. Business men everywhere were urged to come out 
"for an extra session of Congress, and Mrs. French s father "
got the desired diplomatic position. 

Then it was with Mr. Cleveland s consent that the Sec 
retary of State wrote to Mr. Malott at Indianapolis that 
Senator Voorhees business and financial friends in the 
Democratic party should begin their importunities to their 
Senator to join in the movement to repeal the Sherman 
Act. Letters came from every county in Indiana. When 
the Senator heard from the bankers in Green and Owen 
"counties, he remarked, ""And here are Green and Owen; "
"sweet Owen God bless her! she has never failed me."" "
That sealed the fate of the Sherman Silver Act. But for 
"the financial situation, an extra session would have been "
called to revise the tariff. August 7 the special session 
assembled for the sole purpose of repealing the Sher 
man Act. 

Senator Vcorhees had been receiving from the very 
"start all the patronage usually accorded to a senator, or, "
"to put it in other language, all the men that he wanted "
appointed to office were appointed. He never went to the 
White House with his requests but always to the State 
"Department. Henry Watterson, who was a sound money "
"man, said, ""Leave Voorhees to Gresham."" "

I had known Mrs. Voorhees when I was in Washington 
before. Almost daily I saw Senator Voorhees during the 
summer that they were endeavoring to repeal the Sherman 
Act. If he did not come to call on my husband during the 
day my husband went in the evening to see him at his 



jo6 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

residence. Frequently my husband was absent when he 
called. He talked to me a great deal about Thomas A. 
Hendricks and Joseph E. MacDonald. It was never any 
effort to listen to Daniel W. Voorhees. 

At first the Republican leaders were disposed to play 
"politics and let the administration flounder, and they were "
"encouraged in this by Senator Morgan of Alabama, who/ "
had come home chagrined over the defeat in the Bering! 
Sea award. Mr. Morgan declared in a speech in the 
Senate that he would not be cuckoo for the White House 
clock. But the situation was so grave and so acute that 
"partisanship had to be suppressed, and the Republican lead "
"ers of the sound money persuasion, like Senators Aldrich, "
"Hoar, Hale, Lodge, Quay, and Senator Sherman himself "
some of whom had not desired but had acquiesced in 
the passage of the Sherman Act came to the aid of the 
administration and accepted the leadership of a man they 
claimed had stood for all the financial heresies of the times. 

When Walter O. Gresham was assailed for leading in 
the fight for the repeal of the Sherman Act Senator 
"Cullom being one of its instigators, purely for political "
reasons Joseph Medill repudiated his Washington corre 
"spondent, and to use one of Mr. Medill s own expressions, "
"took Shelby by his coat-tails, sat him down in his seat, and "
voted him for the repeal of the act he had helped to pass. 

One of the questions much mooted was how Senator 
Voorhees could justify himself in forcing the passage of 
any act that would tend to lessen the volume of the circu 
"lating medium, as the repeal of the Sherman Act would do. "
I had heard the private discussions. I went to the Senate 
gallery and heard what was said in public. 

Senator Voorhees naively told the people of the country 
"in his speech, when he reported the bill for the repeal of the "
"Sherman Act, that while he was a silver man he was not the "
"kind of a silver man that Senators Aldrich, Gorham, Hale, "
"Morgan, Sherman, and others were, because, as he said, "



SILVER AND THE TARIFF 707 

he had voted against the passage of their Sherman Act. Of 
"course, he might have added which he did not that the "
reason he did not vote for the Sherman Act was because it 
"was limited, while he wanted an unlimited free coinage act. "
I enjoyed the speech. But I could see that Senator Aldrich 
"did not. His face was interesting, as were the faces of "
"Senators Hoar, Fry, and Hale, as Senator Voorhees spoke. "
All they could do was to keep still while Senator Voorhees 
"denounced them as half-baked silver men. ""Some day,"" "
"he said, ""we will get a silver bill that is a silver bill."" "

Late in October the Sherman Silver Act was repealed. 
One argument that was used hinted at in the debate by 
Senator Voorhees and much talked of in the conferences - 
was that as silver was one of the monies mentioned in the 
"Constitution, there was no hostility to it, as money, in "
pressing the repeal of the Sherman Act. J. Sterling Mor 
"ton, the Secretary of Agriculture, induced Cleveland to "
permit him to make an authorized statement that per se 
there was no hostility on the part of the administration to 
silver as money. 

"Statements like these were made, and my husband "
made them and they were potential. They soon had an 
important bearing on Mr. Cleveland s party relations. 

"When the Sherman Act was repealed, there remained r, "
"$9,000,000 of silver bullion in the Treasury. After a time "
the silver men succeeded in getting through Congress a 
"bill providing for the coinage of this $9,000,000 of bullion "
into dollars. It was to be coined on the basis of sixteen 
"to one, while the commercial value of gold to silver was "
about thirty-two to one. Mr. Cleveland was urged to 
"sign the bill, on the theory that it would tend to satisfy "
the silver men and would be keeping faith with some of 
those who had voted for the repeal of the Sherman 
purchasing clause. 

My husband was cne of the men who urged this 
"upon President Cleveland. Furthermore, he said to hirn, "



yo8 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

Eighteen million more of silver dollars in circulation will 
not impair the government credit ; it will get the bullion out 
of the Treasury where it is a continual bait to the silver 
"men."" Then it was that Mr. Cleveland for the first time "
"took the position, as he said, that he would drive the South "
"ern Senators and Representatives to sound money, or, as "
"it was then called, the Gold Standard platform. In reply "
"to this statement, my husband said: ""You cannot drive "
"them your way, but you are liable to drive them out of "
"your party, and with the Silver Republicans put the country "
"on a silver basis."" "

President Cleveland arid all the cabinet were at Arling 
"ton Cemetery on Decoration Day, May 30, 1894. William "
"Jennings Bryan, then a member of Congress, was the orator "
"of the day. As they drove home, in commenting on Mr. "
"Bryan s address, the Secretary of State said to the Presi "
"dent, ""You will have to reckon with this man Bryan in "
"the future."" Still Mr. Cleveland did not believe it. "

"Two years later, at Chicago, I sat on the platform at the "
Democratic National Convention and saw Mr. Bryan walk 
off with the Democratic nomination for president. In the 
various State delegations before me I recognized the faces of 
many of the Southern Senators and Congressmen I had met 
in Washington. The silver men were known to be in a large 
"majority, and were supposed to favor the nomination of "
"Congressman Richard Bland of Missouri, ""Silver Dick,"" as "
he was called. The Cleveland and Hill Democrats in New 
"York had healed their differences for the time, and Senator "
Hill sat at the head of the New York delegation. Governor 
"J. E. Russell, at the head of the Massachusetts delegation, "
"led New England; W. C. Whitney, Colonel J. R. Fellows, "
"the orator of Tammany, and Senator Gray of Delaware, "
made up the complement of gold men. 

"After two days of speeches, many of them most excellent, "
on the loth of June the Committee on Resolutions made 
"its report. Senator Jones of Arkansas, the chairman of "



SILVER AND THE TARIFF 709 

"the committee, presented it. He said there were two "
"minority reports, one advocated by Senator Hill of New "
York and the other by Senator Tillman of South Carolina. 
"The committee had been in session all the night before, "
as was evident from the appearance of the participants. 
"Senator Tillman led off, but made a bad impression. He "
wanted the Cleveland administration censured because it 
"had preserved the gold standard, and he took Senator "
"Hill to task for refusing to unite in the ""merited rebuke."" "
He advocated silver at sixteen to one; said it was a sec 
"tional issue, and boasted, ""I come from the home session."" "
"Senator Jones, an ex-Confederate, was on his feet and was "
cheered to the echo when he repudiated everything Tillman 
had said except his proposition to coin silver at the ratio 
of sixteen to one. 

But Senator Tillman s suggestion about secession was 
"not bad. At any rate, it was adopted later. It should "
"have been immediately, right out of the Convention. It "
all depends on why you secede. South Carolina seceded to 
perpetuate slavery. The New England and New York 
Democrats seceded from their party in 1896 to save the 
"solvency of the nation, but they were so slow about going "
that they almost failed of their object. And when they 
"did start, it took an ex-Confederate or an ex-Secessionist "
to lead them. 

Senator Hill was not happy in the way he began his 
"speech: ""I am a Democrat, and South Carolina with all "
"her power can not drive me out of the party."" He con "
"tended against any single standard, and said the United "
States could not attempt the unlimited coinage of silver 
without the aid of other nations. His main argument was 
bimetallism. He did not then advocate the single gold 
"standard, as he had done in Washington a few months "
"before, as the spokesman in the Senate of the ""sound"" "
money men. 

William Jennings Bryan closed the debate for the silver 



710 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

men. The first word he uttered seemed to reach the last 
man on the outer edge of the vast crowd. He stood right 
by me and I scanned him closely. He appeared taller than 
"he really was, with a young, smooth, and kindly face, but "
a wild and defiant look in his eye that was not natural and 
"I never saw afterwards. He spoke with the utmost ease, "
and seemed possessed of still more physical and vocal 
power than he was expending. That there was a charm 
and fascination in his oratory was manifest from the effect 
on his audience. Only a few refused to go along with him. 
"He answered Senator Hill when he said, If the gold stand "
"ard is the standard of civilization, why, my friends, should "
"we not have it: 3 If they say bimetallism is good, but we "
"can not have it till some nation helps us, we reply that "
"instead of having a gold standard because England has, "
we shall restore bimetallism and let England have bimet 
"allism because the United States has."" "

Then followed such a scene as was never witnessed in 
a National convention. The great majority of the vast 
audience had been with Mr. Bryan from the first word he 
uttered. Their demonstrations were unrestrained as he 
"concluded: ""You can not crucify humanity with a cross "
"of gold and a crown of thorns of gold."" Many staid gold "
standard people were carried off their feet. Aside from 
"New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Massa "
"chusetts, and Connecticut!, where the delegations were all "
"gold men, every State standard except that of Indiana was "
planted by the Nebraska standard. Indiana had a favorite 
son candidate for the Presidency in the person of the chief 
"executive of the State, Claude Matthews, but with all that, "
the Indiana delegates did not want Mr. Matthews nomi 
"nated. For fear of giving color to their feelings, John E. "
Lamb and Senator Turpie held the Indiana banner in its 
isolated position. More than two-thirds of the States 
were represented among the banners that stood by the 
"Nebraska delegation. ""It nominates him,"" went around "



SILVER AND THE TARIFF 711 

"the platform. I said it; Mrs. Palmer said it. ""Never,"" "
said a man who had been to many National conventions. 
Wait until the practical men along about midnight hear 
"from the old man. He will pull his New York, Pennsyl "
"vania, and New England delegates out of the convention "
"and there will be some adjustment."" "

Mrs. Bryan was on the platform and as her husband 
concluded many an eye was turned on her. It was a try 
ing place for any woman. She bore herself well; declining 
"to be interviewed, she withdrew with admirable deftness. "
"When asked, ""How will she do in the White House?"" my "
"answer was, ""You have seen enough; judge for yourself."" "

Pandemonium reigned so long that the convention ad 
journed without voting on the platform. 

The next morning as the platform was adopted the gold 
"men in the New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Penn "
"sylvania, Delaware, and Connecticut delegations sat silent "
They refused to vote aye or nay. It was the greatest 
mistake ever made by a large body of practical men in a 
"political convention. They should have ""walked out."" "

Perhaps Mr. Cleveland could not at that time have led 
his friends to the logical conclusion to which all his acts 
arid advice pointed. But he had the telegraph and the 
"telephone at his command, and in the interval between "
Mr. Bryan s speech and the adoption of the report of the 
majority of the Committee on Resolutions the President of 
"the United States should have attempted to command, or "
"drive, if you please. As soon as Henry Watterson heard "
of the action of the convention he sent a cable from Paris 
to put up an Independent gold ticket. 

"Whatever faults Mr. Cleveland may have possessed, he "
"never, in anyway, either directly or indirectly, profitted by "
"reason of his official position. I mention this, not to give "
"color to a false rumor, but to refute unjust criticism and "
bear my testimony to his worth. Malignity and ignorance 
know no bounds. Because the cupidity of men must be 



712 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

reckoned with by men in the administration of govern 
"mental affairs, is no reason for saying the latter are dis "
honest because the former are. Prompt action in conducting 
a government is sometimes necessary. Words may be and 
often are idle in a crisis. In order to supply the Treasury 
"of the United States with gold, the gold reserve having "
"been depleted before the Sherman Silver Act was repealed, "
"President Cleveland, under authority of the Resumption "
"Acts, sold J. P. Morgan &amp; Company and the Rothschilds "
"$50,000,000 of bonds at par, and they made eight million "
on the deal. Then it was that the New York World and a 
string of bankers criticized the Administration for not hav 
"ing in the first instance offered the bonds to the public, "
and they supplemented their criticism with the statement 
that had they been given the opportunity they would have 
bid more than par for the bonds. The administration was 
"not disturbed by the criticism, but was gratified by the talk "
"of what the gentlemen would do, because it knew that before "
conditions became normal there would have to be more 
"bonds put out. It soon called in its critics, and to their "
"credit be it said, they responded. To have invited bids in "
the first instance would have increased the run on the 
"Treasury, and before a dollar of gold could have been "
realized the country would have been on a silver basis. At 
"the time and under the circumstances, an appeal to Mr. "
Morgan s pride and cupidity was Mr. Cleveland s duty. 

Afterwards Mr. Morgan s vanity led him to assert that 
he showed Mr. Cleveland the way under the Resumption 
Acts to issue bonds to keep the United States Treasury 
"on a specie basis. But the fact is, that at the Lakewood "
"conference, February 22, 1893, President-elect Cleveland, "
"Secretary of State (to-be) Gresham, and Secretary of the "
"Treasury (to-be) Carlisle, canvassed this question and "
decided that under the Resumption Acts the Secretary of 
the Treasury had the power to sell bonds to get gold and 
that it should be done if the emergency arose. 



SILVER AND THE TARIFF 713 

Had the administration of Grover Cleveland been able 
"at the outset to take up the tariff, the real issue on which "
"Mr. Cleveland, was elected, it would have formulated and "
passed a tariff or revenue bill that might have taken the 
"tariff out of politics for a generation; but, as we have just "
"shown, much of its power and practically all of its patron "
"age were exhausted in saving the credit of the nation, in "
repealing the Sherman Act. The service the modest banker 
of Indianapolis rendered the country in the crisis should 
"never be forgotten. For in the ultimate analysis, it was "
Volney T. Malott who repealed the Sherman Silver Act. 

I have already adverted to the simplicity of the Cleve 
"land household. When it came to jewelry and clothing, "
Mrs. Cleveland was economy itself. She never dressed as 
handsomely as I thought the first lady of the land should. 
She had but few jewels a few diamond ornaments and 
pins and an ordinary little diamond necklace. The wife of 
General Draper of Massachusetts I had known as Miss 
"Susie Preston of Lexington, Kentucky. She was a second "
wife. General Draper was then a wealthy manufacturer 
and a minority member of the Ways and Means Committee 
of the House. Mrs. Draper boasted to me at this time that 
she gave dinners enough to make the tariff right as far as 
her husband s business was concerned. She was talking 
about the Wilson bill the bill that the Republicans called 
the Free Trade measure that destroyed the interests of 
the country. 

The Sugar Trust was one of the interests which had a 
large and powerful lobby in Washington. Many members 
of the Senate were said to be interested in sugar stocks. 
My husband did not hesitate to denounce them by name. 1 

"1 March 15, 1893, Secretary Gresham wrote the following letter to Judge Allen of Spring "
"field, Illinois: "

"I have your letter of the 7th, and will inform the President what you think it would "
be wise for him to do at this time. I can readily understand that if the President should 
send such a message some people would charge that he was endeavoring to dictate to a co 
"ordinate branch of the government. The situation is deplorable, and I sometimes fear no "
"tariff bill will pass this session. There are traitors in the camp, so-called Democratic Senators "



714 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"Though the bill was properly drawn in the House, the "
"interests and the high tariff Democrats in the Senate, men "
"like Senators Gorman of Maryland and Morgan of Alabama, "
united with the Republicans in making it largely a protec 
"tionist measure, and hence the name Wilson-Gorman tariff. "
The Sugar Trust got what it desired. It is true that the 
"bill contained many substantial additions to the free list, "
"such as coal, wool, and certain grades of iron, raw materials "
for our manufacturies. Still Mr. Cleveland withheld his 
"signature, and his reasons for not signing it were set forth "
in a letter to Representative Catchings of Mississippi. 
In this letter he said that he could not veto the bill because 
"it contained much that was good, but he would not sign it "
because the time will come when the peoples representatives 
and not the communism of pelf will write the people s tariff 
"laws"" "

That Henry Watterson had good ground for complaint 
against the Wilson Act is not to be questioned. But his 
"criticism of Cleveland because of it, is shown to be unjust "
when we consider Mr. Cleveland s letter to Mr. Catchings. 
During the dog days of 1894 when it looked as if the interests 
might prevent any tariff legislation Mr. Watterson tele 
"graphed Secretary of State Gresham : ""My suggestion is, "
"Get Congress to adjourn without any tariff legislation, then "
with a ringing appeal let the President call an immediate 
session. If he will allow me I shall have a practical propo 
sition to make. Things could not be worse than they are. 
"Assure Mr. Cleveland of my loyal friendship."" "

Friendship does not always influence the judgment and 
so it was Marse Henry s plan that found more favor with 
the President than with the Secretary of State. The latter 

who are strong protectionists and desire to see the McKinley Law remain in force. This may 
"sound incredible to you, but it is true nevertheless. The interests now at stake are stupendous, "
and there is danger some Senators may be approached on their meicenary side. If the session 
"adjourns without tariff legislation being enacted, the people will conclude the Democratic "
"Party has forfeited their confidence. Business will revive after the passage of any bill, or "
after it is demonstrated that no bill can pass; and if none does pass the Republicans will claim 
"they have saved the country from free trade legislation, and that they are entitled to any "
"credit for increased prosperity."" "



SILVER AND THE TARIFF 715 

pressed the contest and a few days later 1 the Wilson bill 
was put in the President s hands. Long afterwards Mr. 
Cleveland stated in my presence that one of his mistakes 
was the refusal to sign that bill. He knew that I knew 
that Walter Q. Gresham had urged him to sign it. Since 
"those days Mr. Watterson has made plain his ""Tariff for "
"Revenue Only. "" It is not free trade. Any tariff, he admits, "
"is protection. Plainly and primarily, a tariff or customs duty "
"is for revenue, but call it what you may, the restraints it "
imposes are protection. It is not surprising that the Wilson 
"Act, passed in the midst of a panic which the tariff barons "
"fomented and kept up as long as they could, was not a "
revenue producer at first. It was denounced from the 
stump by the Republicans as a free trade measure because 
it did not produce the revenue necessary to meet the 
"expenses of the government, and yet before it was repealed "
it was producing a surplus; and as was stated by Speaker 
"Joseph G. Cannon, the Republican ""standpatter,"" in a "
"public speech in defending the Payne-Aldrich bill, the "
average duties in the Payne-Aldrich bill were a trifle lower 
than the average duties in the Wilson-Gorman Tariff Act. 
Consistency is not always essential in political warfare. Mr. 
Cleveland s letter to Mr. Catchings refusing to sign the bill 
was used against it and its income tax provision. 

Judge Gresham advocated the incorporation of the 
income tax in the Wilson Tariff Bill. To the appeals of 
the big men of the country he was impervious. To the 
objection that an income tax was a direct tax and must be 
"apportioned, he said there was the "" Hylton"" 2 case, the case "
in which the first Congress put a tax on carriages; it was 
"admitted by all to be a direct tax, yet it received the "
sanction of President Washington and the Supreme Court. 
The grounds on which the Supreme Court subsequently 
"held the Income Tax Law unconstitutional were canvassed, "

and many a doubter was won over to the theory that 
"such a tax was constitutional. "" President Washington evi "
"dently was of that opinion."" It was believed that Chief "
Justice Fuller thought such a bill would be constitutional. 
But it was finally decided unconstitutional by a divided 
"court, the Chief Justice writing the opinion. When Judge "
Gresham was told in his sick room that the Chief Justice s 
"opinion was very long, thirty pages in length, he said: "
Fuller is in doubt. A long winded opinion by a Court 
usually means that. How did he get around the Hylton 
"and Springer cases ? "" The gossip was in certain of the "
"administration circles, and Walter Q. Gresham was one of "
the men who advanced the theory that the Chief Justice 
became resentful against the administration from the time 
"the President refused to appoint his former law partner, "
"Judge Henry M. Shepard, one of the judges of the Circuit "
"Court of Cook County, to a place on the United States "
"Circuit Court bench in the Seventh Circuit. Instead, John "
W. Showalter was appointed to this place. Joseph Medill 
and Potter . Palmer were very urgent in pressing Mr. 
Shepard s appointment. 

The virulent nature of the language in the dissenting 
"opinions, four to five with one justice changing sides on "
"final hearing, makes it proper to refer, as I have done, to "
rome of the things that were said in private about the 
Income Tax case. 2

BERING SEA ARBITRATION 



FUR SEAL RIGHTS ON PRIBILOF ISLANDS ELAINE AND 
HARRISON NOT IN ACCORD MR. BAYARD S WISE COURSE OF 
ACTION NEUTRAL ARBITRATORS DECIDE THE BERING SEA 

CASE THE UNITED STATES DEFEATED SECRETARY GRES- 

HAM TAKES STEPS TO GET RID OF THE PARIS TRIBUNAL 
REGULATIONS. 

"TT was in the Department of State, during the second "
"-* Cleveland administration, that the greatest public in "
terest centered. 

"The coming Bering Sea arbitration, between the United "
"States and Great Britain nominally, but really with the "
"Dominion of Canada, over the Alaska seal fisheries, sched "
"uled for February 23, 1893, and actually begun thirty days "
"later, was one of the subjects Mr. Cleveland asked Judge "
"Gresham to come to Lakewood to confer about, at the time "
he accepted the office of Secretary of State. In addition 
"to conferring with Cleveland at Lakewood, my husband "
"met our old friend, Colonel John W. Foster, in New York. "
Mr. Foster was then Secretary of State under President 
"Harrison, and was the ""agent of the United States,"" to "
"represent, and to prepare, together with certain eminent "
"counsel, the case of the United States before the Paris "
Tribunal. The questions at issue were not new to Grover 
Cleveland nor to Walter Q. Gresham. 

The controversy came down to this. Either the Cana 
"dian pelagic sealers, among whom were many Americans, "
"would exterminate the seals on the sea, or the American "
"hunters the North American Commercial Company, a "
California corporation and a monopoly fostered by certain 

717



7i8 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

legislation of the Congress of the United States would do 
so on the land. 

The first pelagic sealer was a Yankee sailor who entered 
Bering Sea in 1876. His vessel was captured and con 
demned by the American government. The next time the 
American pelagic sealer entered Bering Sea he showed 
the Canuck the way it was under Canadian register and 
flying the British flag. To quote Senator Morgan before 
the Paris Tribunal: 

The seal hunters had depopulated the Antarctic Ocean of 
"fur seals, and had made many successful raids on the islands "
and coasts of Japan. Their poaching grounds had been exhausted 
and the hope of great profits drew them to Bering Sea. They 
"found governmental resistance in Japan, Russia, and the United "
"States, but they found in Canada a government that would give "
"countenance to their raids, and despite the best efforts of the United "
"States and Great Britain, and of their ordinances closing Bering "
"Sea to them, they now lie upon the north and south route of the migra "
"tion of the seals, which they follow with immense fleets. "

"The Bering Sea arbitration, when sifted to the bottom, "
shows that in 1893 and 1894 Canada was in effect an inde 
pendent nation. London entered the decrees of Ottawa. 
Otherwise there would not have been the fiction of Canadian 
allegiance to the English queen. 

Well do I remember the remark of the brightest English 
"woman I ever met, ""We will never repeat the mistake we "
"made with our American colonies."" "

"When Mr. Gresham was in President Arthur s cabinet, "
I learned of the strong financial interests of the men who 
made up the combination called the lessees which had the 
contracts with the government for the exclusive right to 
take fur seals on the Pribilof Islands. In those days every 
"woman knew much about seals, for sealskin cloaks were "
"still common. About 1893 they were getting expensive, "
more so than in the early 8os. Now they are beyond the 
"reach of the average woman, for the price is prohibitive. "



BERING SEA ARBITRATION 719 

"Wherever taken, the skins were shipped to England, where "
"they were cured, dyed, and then shipped to the big import "
ing houses in the United States. 

These strange animals appear on the rocks of the Pribilof 
"Islands in May, give birth to their young, and after the "
"pups have learned to swim, in October go back into the "
"sea, traveling as far south as San Francisco. Then the "
"next Spring, ""with unerring instinct, one of the strangest "
"phenomena of animal life,"" they not only return to those "
"two small Pribilof Islands situated in the Bering Sea, two "
"hundred miles from the Alaskan coast, but often to the "
identical rocks whence they swam. The islands take their 
"name from a Russian fisherman, who, in 1785, after long "
"search, finally in the fogs and mists found the breeding "
place of the seal. One very interesting feature of seal 
"life, and of the greatest importance in connection with the "
"arbitration, is the fact that during the nurturing season, the "
"female seal, in search of food, swims from one hundred and "
"fifty to two hundred miles from the islands and back, four "
"hundred miles inside of two days, and then picks out her "
pups from ten thousand young. 

Before Secretary Gresham was transferred by President 
"Arthur from the Post-Office Department to the Treasury, "
"in September, 1884, he brought to our library at 1405 "
I Street the statutes and reports of all kinds bearing on 
the workings of the Treasury Department. Among these 
"were Elliott s ""Reports,"" with their bright pictures and fas "
cinating accounts of seal life. Henry W. Elliott of the 
Smithsonian Institution had spent two years in the Pribilof 
"Islands, 1872 and 1874, and had made his detailed report "
"of seal life, which had been translated into seven different "
languages. At the time of this visit the lessees had im 
pressed on Mr. Elliott their benevolence. But theirs was 
the first looting in Alaska. Their attorneys had drafted 
"the legislation Congress had passed in 1869 and 1870, "
which was modeled somewhat after the Russian ordinances 
46



720 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

and continued in the Alaskan Commercial Corporation 
the form of the monopoly Russia had granted for forty 
years prior to the cession to the United States. In 1883 
"and 1884, the lessees were strong in public affairs. Their "
representatives were in the United States Senate and every 
Senator from the Pacific slope was their friend. They w r ere 
"mainly friends of Mr. Elaine, but had an anchor to wind "
"ward before the convention of 1884, in that a few of their "
men were in Mr. Arthur s camp. One of their lobbyists 
"was of the old school. He lived in a fine house, and his "
family went much in official society. 

"Because of the revenue involved, a fixed rental and so "
"much per head for each seal taken, the Pribilof Islands "
and the lessees were under the jurisdiction of the Treasury 
"Department. May i, 1870, when the lease to the Alaskan "
"Commercial Company went into effect for twenty years, "
"the herd consisted of almost 4,700,000 seals. During the "
"period of this lease, 1870-1890, the lessees took 1,856,224 "
"seals, deriving therefrom a net profit of $18,753,911.20, "
"while the government s net profit was but $5,264,230.08. "

"March 12, 1890, a new lease was executed by the United "
"States, for twenty years from May i, 1890. There was "
great competition to get this lease. One of the bidders 
was a party of Indianians headed by Stephen B. Elkins; 
"another, the North American Commercial Company, the "
California corporation in which D. O. Mills was interested. 
Mr Mills was supposed to have been interested in the 
"Alaskan Commercial Company, but he wanted, it was said, "
"to freeze out some of his partners in that company, hence "
it was that the North American Commercial Company was 
organized. Before the North American Company secured 
"the contract, Elkins became a stockholder in it, joined "
"forces with D. O. Mills, and left the Indianians out in "
the cold. Here was a difference in which General Harrison 
sided with his Indiana friends. Mr. Elaine stood by his 
"old friends, Messrs. Elkins and Mills. When the North "



BERING SEA ARBITRATION 721 

"American Company took possession, May i, 1890, the seals on "
"the islands were down to an even 1,000,000. At the expira "
"tion of its lease, May i, 1910, the seals had been reduced to "
"133,000. The lessees profits during this last period were "
"$4,976,574, while the government s expenses, over and above "
"what it derived from the North American Company, were "
"$1,350,000;. in other words, a loss of that amount. "

And now for the case: In 1886 the Canadians and 
"Yankees, under Canadian register, were decimating the "
"herd when Charles S. Fairchild, Secretary of the Treas "
"ury, ordered the United States revenue marine cutters to "
make seizure of Canadian vessels found taking seals in the 
Bering Sea. This order was issued without the sanction 
"of President Cleveland or of Thomas F. Bayard, Secretary "
"of State. Of course, there was a protest by the Canadians "
through the British government. After a careful examina 
"tion of the facts, the precedents, and the law, Mr. Bayard "
decided the course for the United States to pursue was to 
"release the Canadian vessels, withdraw all claim to juris "
diction in the open sea in the North Pacific Ocean and 
"Bering Sea beyond the three-mile limit, and endeavor by "
negotiations to induce the British and Canadian govern 
ments to stop pelagic sealing in the open seas. 

The release of the Canadian vessels aroused the jingoes. 
Senators Hoar and Lodge of Massachusetts assailed Mr. 
Bayard bitterly for his position. But my husband believed 
"then that Mr. Bayard was right, and he was of that opinion "
when he himself became Secretary of State. After the 
failure of the arbitration and the seal herd had been all 
"but exterminated, Mr. Bayard s joint plan with Sir Julian "
"Pauncefote, of an agreement to stop all killing of seals, "
"whether on sea or land, was adopted. At this time, in "
"1886, Mr. Bayard was writing my husband, ""I trust we "
shall always maintain relations of friendship and mutual 
"confidence, and that you will never come to Washington "
"without coming to see me."" "



722 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"Mr. Elaine, as Secretary of State under President "
"Harrison, promptly reversed Mr. Bayard s policy of peace "
"and amity, and proceeded to twist the lion s tail. "

In view of the early indorsement of Secretary Bayard s 
"plan by Mr. Gresham, his subsequent action in the Bering "
"Sea controversy cannot be laid, as some of his critics of "
"that time did, to ill will toward Mr. Blaine and General "
Harrison. On many public questions he had been opposed 
"to Mr. Blaine from the start. Besides, Blaine and Har "
rison themselves were not in perfect accord in the Bering 
"Sea controversy. Certain it is, Mr. Gresham differed from "
them. His opposition not only to their tariff but also to 
their jingo policy had led him to vote against General 
Harrison at the polls. Why anyone should expect him to 
"carry out the policy he had thus emphatically condemned, "
I cannot understand. In striking contrast with the differ 
ences between President Harrison and Secretary of State 
"Blaine, Walter Q. Gresham as Secretary of State was in ac "
"cord with Grover Cleveland as President, and with Thomas "
"F. Bayard, then ambassador to the Court of St. James. "

"Under Mr. Elaine s orders, the revenue cutter Rush "
overhauled and took possession of six or seven Canadian 
"sealers. The first seizure was made July n, 1889. The "
Canadians raised a great uproar and protest that extended 
from Victoria to Ottawa and thence to London. Lord 
"Salisbury protested, and intimated that further seizures on "
"the high seas would be resented. Public opinion, both in the "
"United States and in England, no matter how much the "
"Canadians and American jingoists howled, would not stand "
"for war, so Blaine and Harrison receded and finally, Feb "
"ruary 28, 1892, a treaty of arbitration was signed and in a "
short time was ratified by the United States Senate. 

The language of the diplomatic correspondence was : 

The sole object of the negotiation is the preservation of the 
"fur seal species for the benefit of mankind, and no consideration "
"of advantage to any particular nation, or of benefit to any private "
"interest, should enter into the question. "



BERING SEA ARBITRATION 723 

But this language did not enter into the treaty. Its 
"absence laid the United States open to the charge, which "
"was made before the Paris Tribunal assembled, and also "
"before that body, that she was endeavoring to protect the "
seals for the sole benefit of the lessees. 

"Meanwhile, under a special act of Congress approved "
"April 5, 1890, Henry W. Elliott, still connected as a natur "
"alist with the Smithsonian Institution, was sent by Secretary "
of the Treasury Windom to the Pribilof Islands with plenary 
powers to examine again into seal life and the killing of the 
seals on land as well as on sea. Mr. Elliott was on the 
"Pribilof Islands from May 20 to August 14, 1890. Not "
"withstanding the new lessees had protested bitterly, Secre "
tary Windom had stopped all killing on the islands on the 
"3oth of July. Elliott recommended that killing, both on "
"land and sea, be stopped for a period of years. His con "
clusion was supported by a report of 389 pages in man 
"uscript, with fifty-eight plates, twelve seal charts, maps of "
"the rookeries, and two general maps. "

"It was September 7, 1890, when Elliott first reported "
to Secretary Windom. But Mr. Elliott always claimed 
that Mr. Blaine said then it would not do to publish his 
"report, because its publication would enable the Canadians "
to say it was the killing on land that was decimating the 
"herd. Not until 1896, under an order of Congress, was "
this report published. 

"So instead of following Mr. Elliott s report, which carried "
"out Mr. Bayard s idea and could have been put through, "
"Mr. Blaine was induced by Stephen B. Elkins to suggest, "
"December 17, 1890, to Great Britain that our government "
would be content if the Canadian government would ac 
cept a sixty-mile zone around the Pribilof Islands within 
which pelagic sealing should be prohibited. A sixty-mile 
zone would have left Mr. Elkins company not only free 
"upon the land but also at sea, for we have seen that the "
"female seal, during the nurturing season, went as far as "



724 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

one hundred and fifty to two hundred miles away from the 
Islands. But Lord Salisbury preferred to arbitrate rather 
than accept any of Mr. Elaine s propositions. 

The questions to be determined resolved themselves 
into three: 

1. Did the United States have exclusive jurisdiction 
over the waters of Bering Sea outside of the three-mile limit 
from the shore? 

2. Did the United States have a property interest in 
every seal born and bred on the Pribilof Islands? (Our con 
tention was that they were domestic animals; the Canadian 
or British claim was that they were jeraz natures.) 

3. In the event of the adjudication being adverse to 
"the United States on the first two questions, then the "
arbitrators should determine what concurrent regulations 
were necessary for the proper protection and preservation 
of the fur seal in or habitually resorting to Bering Sea. 

"The first proposition was Mr. Elaine s, the second was "
President Harrison s. They never were in accord. John 
W. Foster urged the second as sound. When lawyers like 
Senators Edmunds and George F. Hoar told Mr. Elaine that 
no international court w r ould hold with the United States 
"on the first two,"" he added the third, in order to secure "
the ratification of the treaty by the Senate. And the pres 
"entation of the third, Mr. Foster says in his official report, "
was unfortunate in that it suggested to the neutral arbi 
trators a doubt as to the soundness of the first two claims 
of the United States. 

"May i, 1892, John W. Foster was appointed by President "
"Harrison agent, on behalf of the United States, to prepare "
the case. From the standpoint of ability and experience 
"as a manager, a better selection than Mr. Foster could not "
"have been made. But in handling a case in a courtroom, "
"the actual trial of a lawsuit, Mr. Foster was without experi "
"ence. Many of his American clients were closely allied, at "
"least in sympathy, with the lessees. Since 1884 Mr. Foster "



BERING SEA ARBITRATION 725 

had been practising his profession of international law in 
Washington. Associated with him as chief counsel for 
the United States was Edmund J. Phelps of Vermont. Mr. 
Phelps had been the American minister to the Court of 
"St. James during the first Cleveland administration, but he "
had not been in complete harmony with Mr. Bayard in 
recognizing Great Britain s right to take the seals in the 
"open seas, that is, outside of the three-mile limit, and "
entering into an agreement with Great Britain whereby the 
"taking of seals at sea, pelagic sealing, should be prohibited. "
"To stop pelagic sealing involved stopping killing on land, "
"on the islands, and to this Mr. Phelps was opposed. As a "
"lawyer, Mr. Phelps s employment mainly was, both before "
"and after this time, with interests associated with the lessees. "
"The other American counsel, James C. Carter and F. R. "
"Coudert, trailed Mr. Phelps. Mr. Coudert s employment "
"was peculiar, as will appear farther on. There were lesser "
"legal lights, one Robert Lansing, a son-in-law of Mr. Foster; "
"also numerous clerks and so-called ""experts."" Our ""expert "
"naturalists"" could not really qualify as such, because they "
were compelled to admit they were on the Islands so short 
a time that their testimony was valueless before the Tribu 
nal. The Canadians kept their men there for over a year 
continuously. 

Federal Judge H. W. Blodgett was of counsel for the 
"United States before the Commission, and he kept Secretary "
of State Gresham well advised of the progress made. 

When the final break between Mr. Blaine and General 
"Harrison came and Blaine resigned as Secretary of State, "
"June 6, 1892, Mr. Foster was made Secretary of State, but "
continued as agent of the United States in managing the 
preparation of the Bering Sea case. As Secretary of State 
he agreed with himself as agent as to what his compensation 
as agent should be. He agreed with Messrs. Phelps and 
"Carter as to their compensation, $10,000 each and expenses. "
"They contemplated, and publicly they claimed, a short "



726 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

hearing and a sure victory. Mr. Foster agreed with our 
"arbitrators as to what their compensation should be, $10,000 "
each. All this was set forth in orders and directions Mr. 
Foster put on the records of the State Department. 

"Great Britain, or more properly, the Dominion of "
"Canada, was represented by the British Attorney-General "
"and Solicitor-General, Sir Charles Russell and Sir Richard "
"Webster, by Charles H. Tupper as agent, and by a corps "
of lesser lights. 

"The American arbitrators, Justice Harlan and Senator "
"Morgan of Alabama, had proceeded to Paris before Judge "
"Gresham went to Lakewood, so that Senator Morgan did "
"not, as he desired to do before sailing, meet the incoming "
"Secretary of State for a conference, as Mr. Cleveland had "
"stated in his letter of February 7, 1893, to Judge Gresham. 1 "

"The arbitrators, on behalf of Great Britain, were the "
"Right Honorable Lord Hannen, Lord of Appeals, and Sir "
"John Thompson, Minister of Justice and Attorney-General "
of Canada. 

"In most arbitrations, the arbitrators of the parties are "
partisans. Such proved to be the case as to the American 
"arbitrators, especially Senator Morgan. Neither the Ameri "
can nor the British arbitrators participated in the final 
conference that decided the case. After the open hearing 
"was concluded, behind closed doors there was an argument "
before the neutral arbitrators by the American and English 
arbitrators. 

"The real judges, as Mr. Foster called them, ""the neutral "
"arbitrators,"" or to use the language of the treaty, ""jurists "
"of distinguished reputation in their respective countries,"" "
"were three in number, and according to the treaty, were "
"named one each by the President of France, the King of "
"Italy, and the King of Norway and Sweden. They were "
"Baron Alphonse de Courcel, Ambassador of France, who "
was made president of the Tribunal at its first meeting; 
"Marquis Emilia, Viscompte Venosta, former Minister of "

1 See page 684. 



BERING SEA ARBITRATION 727 

Foreign Affairs and Senator of the Kingdom of Italy; and 
"Mr. Cregor Grain, Minister of State of Norway. "

"After the conference with Mr. Cleveland at Lakewood, "
"February 22, 1803, Judge Gresham met Secretary of State "
Foster in New York. At this New York conference with 
"Mr. Foster, Judge Gresham frankly expressed his doubts "
about our ability to sustain our contention before the Paris 
"Tribunal, but assured Mr. Foster that every aid the in "
coming administration could give him in managing the 
"case would be extended him. ""The issues have been made "
up and we must stand or fall by what you and our counsel 
"have submitted by way of evidence and printed argument, "
"and what you and they may do before the Tribunal."" "

One reason Judge Gresham gave Mr. Foster why he 
"feared we would fail, was that while he favored the arbi "
"tration of international disputes, the United States could "
not expect to get the benefit of the doubt when the majority 
of the arbitrators were Europeans. 

"March 3, Mr. Foster, with many of the co-counsel, "
"treasury agents, and ""experts,"" sailed for Paris. On the "
same day President-elect Cleveland received the following 
letter from Mr. Phelps: 

"CLARENDON HOTEL, N. Y., March 2, 1893. "
MY DEAR SIR: 

You will remember our conversation in respect to the engage 
ment of Mr. Coudert as one of the counsel in the Bering Sea 
"arbitration. In pursuance of it, Mr. Coudert has been engaged "
and has rendered very useful service. 

It is now necessary that he should go to Paris by the steamer 
"of the nth instant, at the very latest, as otherwise he would not "
arrive in time for the trial. He has never yet received a formal 
authority from the State Department to aet as one of the counsel. 
"His retainer was with the assent of Mr. Foster, Secretary of State "
and agent of the United States in this case; but owing to certain 
"embarrassments of the President in respect to other gentlemen, "
"not necessary to mention, it was desired by Mr. Foster that the "



728 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

formal authority to Mr. Coudert should not be issued until after 
the new administration came in. 

"It is important now, therefore, that it should be sent to him "
"without delay, and even without waiting for the induction of "
Judge Gresham into the Department. Will you kindly direct 
"whoever may be in charge of the Department on Monday next, "
"to send such a formal letter to Mr. Coudert, as by direction of "
"the President, simply engaging him as one of the counsel in the "
"Bering Sea arbitration. His address is F. R. Coudert, Esq., "
"68 William Street, New York City. "

I very much regretted being unable to reach Lakewood on 
"Wednesday in time to see you before you left for Washington, "
"but the situation of my affairs in Burlington, by reason of leav "
"ing here for so long an absence, was such that it was quite im "
possible. 

As Mr. Foster had an interview with Judge Gresham here 
"last week, I hope he may have put him in possession of all the "
points necessary to be referred to. 

"I am, sir, with much respect, "

"Very sincerely yours, "

E. J. PHELPS. 

Mr. Cleveland held the letter and turned it over to 
"Judge Gresham, who arrived in Washington the afternoon "
of the 4th. 

"The British agent was provided with ample funds, and "
"he, his subordinates, and the British arbitrators, all enter "
tained lavishly during the hearing. So profuse were their 
expenditures that Mr. Foster recommended that the allow 
ances to our arbitrators and counsel be increased that they 
might return some of the invitations that were extended 
to them. The allowances of the arbitrators were promptly 
"ncreased as Mr. Foster recommended, and although, as "
"we have shown, the counsel agreed to act for a stipulated "
"sum, their allowances were also increased, although it took "
a deficiency appropriation bill to- pay all our expenses at 
"Paris, including the additional counsel fees. "

"At the first formal session of the Paris Tribunal, April 4, "



BERING SEA ARBITRATION 729 

"1893, the British counsel asked that the agent of the United "
States be ordered to produce the report made by Henry W. 
"Elliott, pursuant to an Act of Congress of April, 1890, on "
"the subject of fur seals in Alaska. This report, as before "
"stated, had not been published. Objecting to the right of "
"the English government to call for this report, still the "
American counsel said they would produce it to be used on 
either side. There was no use to which the American coun 
"sel could put it, because it showed from an American source "
"what the Canadians were contending for, that it was not "
"pelagic killing alone that was decimating the herd, but also "
land killing by the lessees; and that instead of the United 
States desiring to preserve the seal species for the benefit 
"of mankind, it was really standing for private interests, "
"for Stephen B. Elkins, D. O. Mills, and the Calif ornians "
of old. 

The production of this report caused our counsel to recast 
"our case, which they did at much expense and great labor. "
"Instead of a short hearing, it was extended to weeks. "

During the argument on the motion to produce the Elli 
"ott report, James C. Carter and Senator Morgan attacked "
Henry W. Elliott. In an open interview- in the Cleveland 
"Plain Dealer, Professor Elliott answered. He claimed that "
he had taken his report to Mr. Blaine and that Mr. Blaine 
had deliberately suppressed it. He said that the lessees 
had been violating the terms of the lease in taking on the 
"island females and yearlings, contrary to the Federal stat "
"utes and the terms of the lease, and that the treasury "
agents who in 1890 were honest and believed in enforcing 
"the lease, had been removed. This interview was repro "
"duced in Paris, and, of course, all the neutral members of "
the Tribunal read it. Then many of the newspapers at 
"tacked Agent Foster, our counsel, and our arbitrators. They "
claimed that Mr. Foster was spending too much money 
"in Paris, and that the government officers, including our "
"arbitrators, who were under regulation salaries, should not "



730 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

be allowed anything in addition while representing the 
government before the Paris Tribunal. During this time 
Mr. Foster wrote Secretary Gresham many letters com 
plaining about the newspaper attacks. He said they all 
emanated from an employee of the State Department who 
was hostile to him and had been in the State Department 
"prior to Secretary Gresham s coming. An investigation, "
"however, developed that the employee had had nothing to "
do with inspiring the attack. He was absent all this time 
ill in bed. The newspaper man who started the story 
frankly asserted he had received his first information from 
seeing vouchers for additional payments in the Treasury 
"Department. But who else had aided him, he refused to "
disclose. 

That every aid was rendered Mr. Foster by the Cleve 
land administration is conclusive from a statement of 
Mr. Foster in a letter to Secretary Gresham of August 23 
"1893, accompanying Mr. Foster s official report: "

But I cannot close without expressing to you my hearty 
thanks for the ready response which you have always made to 
my requests and recommendations as agent. 

On every point we were beaten. Promptly on the claim 
to jurisdiction beyond the three-mile shore line and that 
the seals were our property because they were domestic 
animals. The neutrals held that we had no right -to such 
jurisdiction and that the seals were feres natures. It was on 
"the regulations that the contest raged, and that we were "
defeated on them is manifest from the dissenting opinions 
of Justice Harlan and Senator Morgan. 

The regulations recommended allowed pelagic sealing 
outside of the zone of sixty geographical miles around the 
Pribilof Islands. They provided for a closed season on the 
high seas north of the 3$th degree of North latitude and 
eastward of the iSoth degree of longitude from Greenwich 
from May i to the 3ist of July. Only sailing vessels could 



BERING SEA ARBITRATION 731 

engage in pelagic sealing during the open season. But on 
these vessels the native fishermen could continue to be em 
"ployed. The use of nets, explosives, and firearms of all "
"kinds, except shotguns, was prohibited. It was to the "
continued use of the shotgun that Senator Morgan most 
strenuously objected. 

"The sixty-mile limit was, as we have seen, Mr. Elaine s "
suggestion. The Indian fisherman with his spear and un 
"erring aim was the most deadly enemy of all to the seal, "
because when one seal was shot a hundred were warned 
"away, while the Indian did his work noiselessly. "

"Not only were we defeated on every proposition, but "
Secretary of State Gresham thought the positions of our 
counsel and arbitrators reflected but little credit on the 
American bar and judiciary. 

"This appeared when, in response to the question of "
"Baron de Courcel why, under that clause of the treaty which "
authorized the arbitration to determine what concurrent 
regulations were necessary for the proper protection and 
preservation of the fur seals at or habitually resorting to 
"Bering Sea, a closed season on both land and sea could not "
"be ordered, Messrs. Phelps, Carter, and Coudert asserted that "
under the treaty of arbitration the arbitrators were power 
less to suggest regulations to stay the slaughter on land. 

When the evidence showed that any regulations short 
of a prohibition of pelagic sealing would result in the total 
"destruction of the seal herd, and our counsel and arbitrators "
urged that the regulations should totally prohibit the tak 
"ing of seals at sea, Canadian Arbitrator Sir John Thompson "
said that if the treaty as the American counsel contended 
"did not contemplate a closed season on land, it could not "
possibly have been contemplated that the Canadian fisher 
"men should be excluded from the sea, and he agreed with "
them that regulation was not prohibition. 

Accepting this interpretation of the treaty as he was 
"forced to do, although he said it was a reflection on the "



732 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"intelligence of President Harrison, Secretary of State Elaine "
"and the United States Senate, in unanimously ratifying it, "
Justice Harlan proposed to adjourn the Tribunal without 
"a decision, and pending the adjournment let the two ""high "
"contracting parties"" so amend the treaty that the Tribunal "
"would have the power, if it appeared necessary to preserve "
"the seals, entirely to prohibit pelagic sealing. But Justice "
Harlan said the United States would never consent to 
vesting in any arbitral tribunal the power to stop the kill 
ing of the seals on the islands; that would be an inva 
sion of her sovereignty. The language of the diplomatic 
correspondence as we have quoted it certainly contem 
plated arresting the slaughter on the islands. 

"Instead of adjourning, the neutral arbitrators deemed "
it their duty to decide as best they could with what was 
before them. They held that the power to regulate the 
taking of the seals in the open sea did not comprehend the 
power to prohibit. 

"Then the Tribunal, going entirely outside of its province, "
"as Secretary of State Gresham said, handed Justice Harlan "
and the United States this poser. It recommended that by 
"a new treaty to be negotiated by the two powers, all killing, "
"both on land and sea, be prohibited for a term of years. "
"Beaten on the regulations for taking seals in the open seas, "
Secretary of State Gresham said to our arbitrators and coun 
"sel: ""We cannot ask Great Britain to restrain the Canad "
ians so long as the legislation we have on the statute books 
permits our people to slaughter or exterminate the seals on 
"land."" Later it will appear how he proposed the only "
"remedy, that of the repeal of the legislation of 1869-1870. "

"After the hearing was over, Messrs. Carter, Phelps, and "
Coudert said the case had been badly made up and badly 
"prepared, and they differed amongst themselves as to what "
had been done and what should be done. But in true 
"lawyer style, they united in cursing the court. The respon "
"sibility of defeat, Agent Foster said was not his! "



BERING SEA ARBITRATION 733 

In his autobiography Mr. Foster says Judge Gresham 
was no diplomat. Possibly he is correct. For after ac 
"knowledging in his official report our defeat on every point, "
Mr. Foster joined our counsel and arbitrators in publicly 
proclaiming we had won a victory. Mr. Phelps and Mr. 
"Lansing, Mr. Foster s son-in-law, were particularly insistent "
"on this; also Senator Morgan, although he wrote Secretary "
"Gresham on August 28 that we would be defeated, not only "
on our claim of property in the seals and jurisdiction beyond 
"the three-mile line, but also on the proposed regulations. "
This was in connection with Justice Harlan s plan to force 
"an adjournment of the hearing, that the treaty which he "
said had been wrongly drafted might be amended in 
"other words, escape the oncoming verdict. Secretary of "
State Gresham believed in making a practical application 
of the doctrine even if it be the first that there is 
"such a thing as international morality."" So no sanction "
"was given to the proposition to break up the hearing; and, "
in his answer to Mr. Foster s claim that we had won a vic 
"tory, he wrote on September 3 : "

I do not believe it is right to seek to make the impression that 
"we succeeded in our contentions before the Tribunal, for we did "
"not. The decision having been adverse to our claim, the arbi "
trators then prescribed regulations for the preservation of the 
"seal not, however, as our property. "

The Paris Tribunal decided that we were liable for the 
seizures of the Canadian vessels in Bering Sea in 1886 and 
"1890, but left the amount of damages to be adjusted by "
the high contracting parties. Secretary of State Gresham 
"and Sir Julian Pauncefote agreed on $425,000 as the amount. "
"Congress, under the lead of Senator Morgan and the Repub "
"lican jingoists, refused to sanction the settlement. Instead, "
"a joint commission met at Vancouver, heard evidence, and "
"awarded the Canadians $473,000, which we paid, and also "
a big bill of costs. 

That Senator Morgan was an unfit man as an arbitrator 



734 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

in any controversy is manifest when it is considered that 
in the beginning of his argument behind closed doors and 
before the neutral arbitrators had made the regulations 
"they recommended, he said that the United States would "
not be bound by these regulations if made. And he cer 
tainly afterwards did his best to prevent our observing them. 
"A professed Democrat, Senator Morgan always stood for "
"privilege. In a letter of May 29, 1894, from London, Mr. "
Bayard said of him: 

Mr. Morgan s duplicity and eccentricity as related in your 
letters are but repetitions of what I learned by prior experience. 
"Brilliant often, and remarkably inventive, his judgment is fre "
quently unsound and his nature utterly unreliable. I cannot 
recall a single important service he has rendered his country or 
"his party, and in many cases he has proposed action that would "
have been disastrous to both if he had succeeded. Mr. Cleveland 
knew my opinion of him during his first administration. 

The regulations were to be enforced by concurrent act 
"ion. In other words, the United States was not given the "
power outside of her territorial limits three miles from 
the shore line to compel the either Canadian or the En 
glishman to obey the regulations prescribed by the Tribunal 
and to be adopted by the respective governments. 

"Because Secretary Gresham would not sanction, with "
"out authority from the British government, our revenue "
cutters seizing the Canadian fishermen Senator Morgan 
and F. R. Coudert urged this he was denounced as truck 
"ling to Great Britain. Senator Morgan and Mr, Coudert "
took this position because they said it would open up the 
case again. But the Secretary of State rejected both their 
reasoning and their conclusion. 

"The bill for carrying out the award on our part, which "
"Secretary Gresham drew, Senator Morgan said was admir "
"able, but as chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs "
of the United States Senate he was for resorting to all kinds 
"of duress to force Great Britain to agree to a closed season, "



BERING SEA ARBITRATION 735 

"to modify the regulations, and to authorize the United States "
to seize English and Canadian vessels in Bering Sea. He 
"threatened to repeal the Clay ton- Bui wer treaty; that is, "
he induced Senator Dolph of Oregon to introduce a reso 
lution to that effect. 

"Early in September, 1893, Secretary of State Gresham "
"took up with Sir Julian Pauncefote, who was then in "
"Washington, the recommendations prescribed by the Paris "
"Tribunal, in order to secure their modification, a new "
"treaty, or their joint enforcement. The claim being made "
"that Sir Julian was making delay, the whole matter was "
referred to Mr. Bayard that he might get a prompt agree 
ment with the British government. It was at this time 
that Mr. Bayard suggested the employment of Professor 
"John Bassett Moore, and the British government did not "
"want to recognize the Canadians in the negotiations, but "
"did not dare to say so. Accordingly, Mr. Bayard was "
advised that the American government would not agree 
that the Canadians should participate in the conference. 
"By December, Mr. Bayard wrote that he must come to "
Washington for a conference with .the Secretary of State 
"and Mr. Cleveland. He came, conferred, and returned. "
"But, excluded from the conference, the Canadians, among "
whom Senator Morgan said that there were a lot of 
"Yankees, as there were, controlled the situation. Great "
"Britain was willing to come to any terms we asked, but "
she could not agree to a closed season at sea because the 
Canadians said it w r ould redound only to the benefit of the 
"North American Commercial Company, while the actual "
"regulations recommended and to be enforced, the Canadians "
"said, were good enough for them and meanwhile they were "
getting ready for the greatest catch ever. 

"As had been predicted, the Canadians took more seals "
by twenty thousand in 1894 than ever before. Then in 
"November, 1894, Walter Q. Gresham set about getting rid "
of the award and regulations of the Paris Tribunal. 
47



736 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"In counsel with Professor Elliott, Congressman Nelson "
"Dingley, W. L. Wilson, of the Ways and Means Committee "
"of the House, ex-Speaker Thomas B. Reed, and James B. "
"McCreary, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee "
"of the House, the following steps were taken: "

"December n, 1894, Mr. Dingley introduced a resolution "
calling on the Secretary of the Treasury to show how the 
regulations of the Bering Sea Commission had operated 
"during the season of 1894, and in support of the resolution "
"he quoted the statement of Messrs. Foster, Phelps, Carter, "
"and Coudert of August and September, 1893, that the "
"regulations would prove effective, and a letter of Henry W. "
"Elliott of December 10, 1894, stating that the slaughter in "
"1894 had been greater than ever before, and that if the "
regulations were continued it would be only a short period 
"of years until the seals were exterminated. On January 23, "
on the coming in of the report from the Secretary of the 
"Treasury, Mr. Dingley said this report showed that ""the "
Paris regulations of the Alaska seal fisheries have been a 
"flat failure."" Further, he said, ""If the regulations continue "
"in effect three or five years longer, the seal herd w r ill be ex "
terminated and the United States will lose its revenue from 
"the annual taking of $10,000,000 w r orth of property. "" Better "
"that this $10,000,000 worth of property should be seized at "
once by the United States and converted into cash. There 
fore Mr. Dingley introduced a bill to repeal the legislation 
"of 1868, 1869, and 1870, which authorized the leasing of "
"the right to take the seals on the islands, and directed the "
"Secretary of the Treasury to take, with all expedition "
"possible, every seal on the island and convert the skins into "
"cash, but with this proviso: "

The President may by proclamation suspend the execution 
of this act if Great Britain shall have determined to cooperate 
"with the United States in such measures as, in the judgment of "
"the President, will prevent the extermination of the Alaskan "
seal herds. 



BERING SEA ARBITRATION 737 

"Big Brainy"" Tom Reed, as he was called, supported "
"Mr. Dingley s bill. Speaking of the regulations, he said, "
We are paying a large sum of money annually to enable 
"the Canadian sealers to do their work more effectively."" "

"This bill went through the House, but its passage was "
"delayed in the Senate until the session ended, March 4, 1895. "
"In the Senate, privilege was then strong. Senator Morgan "
was opposed to the new legislation and Stephen B. Elkins 
was for standing by the Acts of 1869 and 1870. Had Sec 
"retary Gresham lived, he would have gotten the bill through "
the Senate. It was one of the things he was planning when 
his last sickness came on him. Again in 1896 the bill went 
through the House but not the Senate. In 1910 the lease 
"expired by limitation, and then the private interest lapsed. "
"The seal herd was by that year reduced to 133,000. Then "
the United States was able to do what Mr. Bayard and 
"Walter Q. Gresham had advocated, namely, secure a treaty "
"with Great Britain or rather, Canada that stopped the "
killing of seals on both land and sea for a long term of years.

FOR THE RIGHTS OF THE LITTLE NATION. 

TT was the Hawaiian policy of the Cleveland adminis- 
-* tration that brought down on my husband the greatest 
criticism of the Republicans. This criticism involved them 
"in confusion and contradiction, for it required them to assert "
what many finally on the floor of the House and Senate 
"shrank from doing, ""that none but rich men, none but white "
"men, none but Anglo-Saxon white men, are entitled to life, "
"liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" "

Conscious of his own strength and that of the American 
"people, Secretary of State Gresham insisted on taking the "
"moral position that ""Right and Justice"" should control the "
"greatest power on earth in its international relations, in "
opposition to the narrow technical rules which preserved 
to the wrong -doer the advantages his fraud and cunning 
"had gained for him or it, to expediency, and to the policies "
of conquest and imperialism that Mr. Elaine had inaugu 
rated and General Harrison for a time had followed and final 
ly most actively opposed. If my husband was actuated only 
"by resentment towards President Harrison, the Republican "
"leaders, and the Republican party, he had the satisfaction "

738



HAWAII 739 

of knowing that he embarrassed them greatly and that he 
exposed much of their cant and hypocrisy about a free 
ballot and a fair count. Never since the debate on what 
"was done in Hawaii in 1892 and 1893, and the repeal of the "
"Enforcement Acts,  has there been Republican complaint "
about suppression of the negro vote in the South. The 
"South"" to a man, except Senator Morgan, supported the "
Cleveland Hawaiian policy. The ex-Confederates like Gen 
"eral ""Joe"" Wheeler, as he was universally called, were cordial "
"and unqualified in their proffers of support. ""Right off the "
"reel,"" the News and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina, "
"was in the breach. In an editorial on ""Carpet Baggers"" "
"it said, ""American interests is the cry now: Republican "
interests in the South was the cry then. The unspeakably 
degraded and dissolute Liliuokalani is not good enough for 
Carpet Baggers in Hawaii ; the unspeakably degraded and 
dissolute negro statesmen were good enough for nearly all 
"the respectability, intelligence, wealth, and civilization in the "
"South. "" "

"The Hawaiian discussion passed House Bill No. 2133, "
repealing the Federal statutes authorizing the appointment 
"of deputy United States marshals and supervisors, and the "
statutes known as the Enforcement Acts (already discussed) l 
and designed to control elections in the South. Under the 
"Enforcement Acts, Democrats had been convicted in Bal "
"timore, Cincinnati, and Indiana, but never a Republican. "
"When the Dudley ""Blocks of Five"" case arose, it did not "
apply. Senator George F. Hoar of Massachusetts was one 
of the Republican senators who had aided in blocking the 
"Dudley prosecution. In the debate on House Bill No. 2133, "
"he wailed, ""I am now one of the five men in Congress who "
"voted for this legislation. The Democrats talk about Hawaii, "
"the New England Puritans, and the Hartford Convention "
events of two or three hundred years ago when we 
"refer to the wrongs of the negroes of the South."" "

1 See Chapter XXX. 



740 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"Henry M. Teller, then a Republican senator from Colo "
"rado, who had been in the Arthur cabinet with my husband "
"and was one of his strongest supporters in 1888, so ardent "
a silver man that he afterwards left the Republican party 
"in 1896, said that at first it was a question in the Senate as "
"to who was responsible for the crux of the Hawaiian policy, "
"the attempt to restore Liliuokalani, the Secretary of State "
"or the President, but later he said that they were satisfied "
Gresham was the man. All doubt as to this is removed by 
the letter of Attorney-General Richard A. Olney of Octo 
"ber 9, 1893. While agreeing with the sound morality of your "
"proposition,"" the policy of the course advised was questioned. "
"If the question of expediency is omitted, a clear, legal, con "
stitutional and most human exposition of the situation is 
this letter. 1 Of Mr. Cleveland s special message in favor of 
"the restoration of the queen, the lawyers and Gresham critics "
"said that while it showed all of the Cleveland force, it re "
vealed the polish and logic of the man who had long spoken 
from the equity side of the court. 

"Sunday, January 29, 1893, as we have seen, w r as a red- "
letter day in my life. It was the day Don M. Dickinson 
says I made him so uncomfortable when he came to our 
house bearing Mr. Cleveland s special message requesting 
my husband to become Secretary of State. 

The newspapers of that day contained the first mention 
of my husband s name in connection with the State Depart 
"ment in the incoming administration. They said that, the "
"day before, Henry Watterson was in town and had spent a "
long time with Judge Gresham. 

"But the startling and heavy headlines were, ""Revolt in "
"Hawaii."" While the conference went on in the library, I "
endeavored to divert my mind by reading about the landing 
the day before at San Francisco of the commissioners from 
"the provisional government of Hawaii, and their haste to "
get on to Washington. The papers had maps and pictures 

1 See Appendix C for this letter in full. 



HAWAII 741 

of tropical life. They told how the queen had been deposed. 
"In order to prevent bloodshed, she had yielded to the supe "
rior forces of the United States of America when Minister 
Plenipotentiary John L. Stevens had caused United States 
troops to be landed at Honolulu and declared he would 
"support the provisional government. A woman in trouble, "
"my husband would certainly side with her against the power, "
"greed, and lust of man. "

The next morning the Chicago Tribune was out for an 
"nexation and Hawaii as a State, and said Elaine wanted "
"the Hawaiian Islands, and that, as far back as when he was "
"Secretary of State in President Garfield s cabinet, he had in "
"structed Mr. Stevens then, as now, our accredited minister "
"there ""to get them."" "

Immediately the press teemed with the question of 
annexation and of the United States adopting a colonial 
"policy. And against both, my husband promptly took his "
position. Interviews with members of Congress and the 
Senate showed much diversity of sentiment. In the House 
the majority was clearly adverse if not noncommittal. 
Ex-Speaker Thomas B. Reed was in the latter class. James 
"H. Blount of Georgia, chairman of the Foreign Relations "
"Committee of the House, refused to be interviewed. Sena "
"tor John T. Morgan of Alabama, chairman of the Committee "
"on Foreign Affairs of the Senate, was for annexation. "

"Meanwhile the Hawaiian commissioners, five in number "
"three of whom were born on the Islands, the descendants "
"of missionaries, and two British subjects were crossing "
"the country. They passed through Chicago February 2, "
giving interviews claiming that President Harrison and also 
President-elect Cleveland favored annexation. Cleveland 
"in an interview in New York said, ""I have not expressed "
"an opinion on the question of annexation, and if I had an "
opinion I do not consider that it would be proper for me 
"to express it at the present time."" "

"January 30, Senator William E. Chandler by resolution "



742 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"requested the President to lay before Congress, both Houses, "
"for ratification, any treaty he might make. This, it was "
"given out, was to prevent action by the Senate behind closed "
doors. 

"Speaking of his resolution and of annexation, on Janu "
"ary 3 1 , Senator Chandler said : : The United States govern "
ment has never shown any disposition to destroy the native 
"government of Hawaii. On the contrary, it has always "
maintained such government and had attempted to keep 
in power the existing dynasty. But at the same time there 
"had been a feeling that if the native government should fail, "
an American solution would be found for the difficulties on 
"the Islands. And if it should appear that a stable, inde "
pendent government could not be maintained and that the 
"support of any foreign government should be required, then "
the sentiment was that the United States would be willing 
"and desirous to annex the Islands."" "

Senator Chandler s wife was a daughter of John P. Hale. 
"One day, at 1405 I Street, after one of President Arthur s "
"cabinet meetings, my husband and Mr. Chandler came in "
"to luncheon. After jokes and some general conversation, I "
"heard them discussing all the ""men and measures"" of the "
time and not always in harmony. My husband suddenly 
"and with much seriousness and directness said, ""Chandler, "
had I been old enough I would have voted for John P. 
Hale; his treatment afterwards by the Republicans was 
"infamous."" Mr. Chandler choked up and the conversation "
switched to a less serious subject. Not long after that an 
article appeared in one of the magazines by Secretary of 
"the Navy W. E. Chandler, in w r hich Postmaster-General "
Gresham was credited with the youthful indiscretion of 
"having served time on a branch of the ""Underground "
"Railroad."" "

"Bill Chandler, as he had been universally spoken of "
until Mr. Arthur invited him to become Secretary of the 
"Navy, had come to Washington at the close of the war as "



HAWAII 743 

a protege of Mr. Elaine. He first had charge of litigation 
for the Navy Department. A graduate of the Harvard 
"Law School, he was a thoroughly trained lawyer. He had "
"practised in New Hampshire, his native State, served in its "
"legislature, and after establishing his law office in Wash "
"ington, served for years as the New Hampshire member of "
"the Republican National Committee. His virile, incisive "
tongue and pen and bitter partisanship made him many 
enemies. When President Garfield sent his name to the 
"Senate as Solicitor-General, senators like Edmunds, Hoar, "
"Dawes, and ""John Logan,"" as Mr. Chandler always spoke "
"of General Logan, united with Senator Conkling in prevent "
ing his confirmation. The only dissentient voice in t lo 
"newspapers, whether Republican or Democratic, in announ?- "
"ing the result of the election of 1876, that Tilden had been "
"elected, was that of ""Bill"" Chandler, the secretary of the "
Republican National Committee. Mr. Chandler declared 
"that the States of Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina "
"had honestly voted for Hayes, who would receive their "
"electoral votes, although on the face of the returns Tilde i "
"had a popular majority in each State. Then ""returni^ "
"boards,"" ""visiting statesmen,"" President Grant and hi . "
"army, and an Electoral Commission created by a special "
"act of Congress, made good ""Bill"" Chandler s claim, a "
claim I have heard my husband say to him should never 
have been made or sustained. Then he would chuckle and 
"laugh. But with all his partisanship, William E. Chandler "
was a broad man. As his resolution and the remarks we 
"have quoted indicate, he was no jingoist and never was he "
an exploiter of the weak or inferior races that men even 
in New England might thereby make money. Neither was 
he ever a critic of Secretary Gresham and the Cleveland 
"administration for any phase of the Hawaiian policy, nor "
did he raise his voice in defense of Minister John L. Stevens 
"and the Blaine policy of ""grab"" in Hawaii. Indeed, he lent "
"a helping hand at one stage of the contest, as will appear "



744 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

a little later on. And his offer to Secretary Gresham to 
champion on the floor of the Senate certain measures of the 
"State Department, both he and my husband afterwards "
concluded it would not be wise to have him do for fear 
of arousing the jealousy or hostility of certain Democrats. 
Certain it is that Senator Chandler s words of caution in 
his resolution and remarks of January 31 were unheeded. 

"February 3, the commissioners of the provisional gov "
ernment of the Hawaiian Islands arrived in Washington. 
February 4 they had their first meeting with Secretary of 
"State Foster. Then, on February 14, the treaty of annex "
ation between the United States and the commissioners of 
"the provisional government of the Hawaiian Islands, hav "
"ing in the meantime been negotiated, was transmitted by "
President Harrison to the United States Senate. 

This haste on the part of Secretary of State Foster when 
he was up to his ears recasting our case for the arbitration 
"with Great Britain about the Alaskan fur seals, although "
"Senator Hoar did not state it that way, was one of the "
subjects of the conference between Cleveland and Gresham 
"at Lakewood, February 22, 1893. At this conference the "
"letter of the Hawaiian queen, of January 19, to President "
"Harrison, which he made public February 18, in which the "
"queen asked for delay that her side might be heard, and "
"the queen s letter of the same date to Mr. Cleveland, were "
"also considered. In her letter to Mr. Cleveland, the queen "
asserted that the provisional government had the sanction 
of neither a popular revolution nor suffrage. 

"March 7, 1893, President Cleveland withdrew, as he "
"lawfully could, the treaty of annexation from the Seriate. "
Immediately there was great criticism by the Republicans 
and much interest manifested by the people and the press- 
My husband advised Mr. Cleveland to send a special com 
"missioner to Honolulu at once to get all ""the facts."" "

"So on the nth day of March, 1893, Hon. James H. "
"Blount, a former member of Congress from Georgia, and "



HAWAII 745 

late chairman of the Committee of Foreign Affairs in the 
"House, was appointed a special commissioner of the Presi "
dent to visit the Hawaiian Islands with a view to obtaining 
the fullest possible information in regard to the condition 
"of affairs in the Islands, and especially data as to the "
revolution or so-called revolution which led to the over 
throw of the queen s government. He was given para 
mount authority over the diplomatic and naval officers 
"in the Islands, and was particularly instructed that while "
the United States troops could be landed to protect Ameri 
"cans and their property, they could not be used for any "
other purpose; and that while the United States would not 
"interfere in the domestic affairs of Hawaii, neither would "
it allow any other nation to do so. 

Again there was great criticism in the press and among 
"the Republicans, that the President and the Secretary of "
State had usurped powers not granted them by the Con 
"stitution, in appointing a special commissioner to investigate "
the affairs of another country without the consent of the 
Senate. These criticisms were answered by showing that 
even as far back as Washington s time this had been done. 
An even hundred precedents were furnished by the State 
Department for the appointment by the President of a 
special commissioner to visit a foreign country without the 
"advice and consent of the Senate, and since that debate "
the practice has never been questioned. 

The criticisms broke forth afresh when word came that 
Commissioner Blount had ordered the American flag hauled 
"down from the government buildings in Honolulu, and had "
sent the American sailors and marines back on board of the 
Boston. Quick was the answer: The flag had been hoist 
ed as part of Minister Stevens s scheme of a protectorate 
which he had declared over the provisional government 
but which President Harrison had promptly disowned as 
"soon as he heard of it. Why, then, should the flag stay up? "

"In due time Mr. Blount made his report, accompanying "



746 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

it with the evidence he had taken on his visit to the Islands. 
From this report the Secretary of State culled the facts 
and on it he based his recommendation to the President. 
"This letter, and the instructions to our minister to the "
Hawaiian Islands to restore the Hawaiian queen to her 
"throne because she had been wrongfully dethroned, follows : "

"DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, D. C., "

"October 18, 1893. "
THE PRESIDENT: 

The full and impartial reports submitted by the Honorable 
"James H. Blount, your special commissioner to the Hawaiian "
"Islands, establishing the following facts: "

"Queen Liliuokalani announced her intention on Saturday, "
"January 14, 1893, to proclaim a new constitution, but the oppo "
sition of her ministers and others induced her speedily to change 
her purpose and make public announcement of that fact. 

"At a meeting in Honolulu, late on the afternoon of that day, "
"a so-called Committee of Public Safety, consisting of thirteen "
"men, being all or nearly all who were present, was appointed to "
consider the situation and devise ways and means for the main 
"tenance of the public peace and the protection of life and property, "
"and at a meeting of this committee on the isth, or the forenoon "
"of the 1 6th of January, it was resolved amongst other things that "
a provisional government be created to exist until terms of union 
with the United States of America have been negotiated and 
"agreed upon."" At a mass meeting which assembled at 2 p. M. on "
"the last named day, the queen and her supporters were con "
"demned and denounced, and the committee was continued and "
all its acts approved. 

Later the same afternoon the committee addressed a letter 
"to John L. Stevens, the American minister at Honolulu, stating "
that the lives and property of the people were in peril and appeal 
ing to him and the United States forces at his command for assist 
"ance. This communication concluded: ""We are unable to pro "
"tect ourselves without aid, and therefore hope for the protection "
"of the United States forces. "" On Veceipt of this letter Mr. Stev "
"ens requested Captain Wiltse, commander of the U. S. S. Boston, "
"to land a force for the protection of the United States legation, "



HAWAII 747 

"United States consulate, and to secure the safety of American life "
"and property. The well-armed troops, accompanied by two "
"gatling guns, were promptly landed and marched through the "
"quiet streets of Honolulu to a public hall, previously secured by "
Mr. Stevens for their accommodation. This hall was just across 
"the street from the government building, and in plain view of "
the queen s palace. The reason for thus locating the military 
will presently appear. The governor of the island immediately 
addressed to Mr. Stevens a communication protesting against 
the act as an unwarranted invasion of Hawaiian soil and remind 
ing him that the proper authorities had never denied permission 
to the naval forces of the United States to land for drill or any 
other proper purpose. 

About the same time the queen s Minister of Foreign Affairs 
sent a note to Mr. Stevens asking why the troops had been landed 
and informing him that the proper authorities were able and will 
ing to afford full protection to the American legation and all 
American interests in Honolulu. Only evasive replies were sent 
to these communications. 

While there were no manifestations of excitement or alarm 
"in the city, and the people were ignorant of the contemplated "
"movement, the committee entered the government building, "
"after first ascertaining that it was unguarded, and read a proc "
lamation declaring that the existing government was overthrown 
"and a provisional government established in its place, to exist "
until terms of union with the United States of America have 
been negotiated and agreed upon. No audience was present 
"when the proclamation was read, but during the reading forty "
"or fifty men, some of them indifferently armed, entered the room. "
The executive and advisory councils mentioned in the proclama 
"tion at once addressed a communication to Mr. Stevens, inform "
ing him that the monarchy had been abrogated and a provisional 
government established. This communication concluded: 

"Such provisional government has been proclaimed, is now "
"in possession of the government department buildings, the ar "
"chives, and the treasury, and is in control of the city. We hereby "
"request that you will, on behalf of the United States, recognize "
it as the existing dc facto government of the Hawaiian Islands 
"and afford to it the moral support of the government, and, if "



748 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"necessary, the support of American troops to assist in preserving "
"the public peace."" "

"On account of this communication, Mr. Stevens immediately "
"recognized the new government, and, in a letter addressed to "
"Sanford B. Dole, the President, informed him that he had done "
so. Mr. Dole replied: 

"Government Building, Honolulu, "

January 17. 1893. 

Sir: I acknowledge receipt of your valued communications 
"of this day, recognizing the Hawaiian provisional government, "
and express deep appreciation of the same. 

" T \Ve have conferred with the ministers of the late government, "
and have made demand upon the marshal to surrender the station 
house. We are not actually yet in possession of the station house 
but as night is approaching and our forces may be insufficient to 
"maintain order, we request the immediate support of the United "
States forces and would request that the commander of the United 
"States forces take command of our military forces, so that they "
may act together for the protection of the city. 
" Respectfully yours, "

"Sandford B. Dole, "

"His Excellency John L. Stevens, Chairman Executive Council. "
United States Minister Resident. 

Note of Mr. Stevens at the end of the above communication : 
The above request not complied with. Stevens. 

"The station house was occupied by a well-armed force, under "
"the command of a resolute, capable officer. The same afternoon "
"the queen, her ministers, representatives of the provisional govern "
"ment, and others held a conference at the palace. Refusing to "
"recognize the new authority or surrender to it, she was informed "
that the provisional government had the support of the American 
"minister, and, if necessary, would be maintained by the military "
force of the United States then present; that any demonstration 
on her part would precipitate a conflict with that force; that she 
"could not, with hope of success, engage in war with the United "
"States, and that resistance would result in a useless sacrifice of "
"life. Mr. Damon, one of the chief leaders of the movement, and "
"afterwards vice-president of the provisional government, informed "



HAWAII 749 

the queen that she could surrender under protest and her case 
"would be considered later at Washington. Believing that, under "
"the circumstances, submission was duty, and that her case would "
"be fairly considered by the President of the United States, the "
queen finally yielded and sent to the provisional government 
"the paper, which reads: "

"I, Liliuokalani, by the grace of God and under the consti "
"tution of the Hawaiian Kingdom, Queen, do hereby solemnly "
protest against any and all acts done against myself and the 
constitutional government of the Hawaiian Kingdom by certain 
persons claiming to have established a provisional government 
of and for this kingdom. 

That I yield to the superior force of the United States of 
"America, whose minister plenipotentiary, His Excellency John L. "
"Stevens, has caused United States troops to be landed at Honolulu "
and declared that he would support the provisional government. 

Now to avoid any collision of armed forces and perhaps the 
"loss of life, I do, under this protest, and impelled by said forces, "
yield my authority until such time as the government of the 
"United States shall, upon the facts being presented to it, undo "
the action of its representative and reinstate me and the authority 
which I claim as the constitutional sovereign of the Hawaiian 
"Islands."" "

When this paper was prepared at the conclusion of the con 
"ference, and signed by the queen and her ministers, a number of "
"persons, including one or more representatives of the provisional "
"government, who were still present and understood its contents, "
"by their silence at least acquiesced in its statements, and, when it "
"was carried to President Dole, he indorsed upon it, ""Received "
"from the hands of the late cabinet this iyth day of January, 1893,"" "
"without challenging the truth of any of its assertions. Indeed, "
"it was not claimed on the iyth day of January, or for some time "
"thereafter, by any of the designated officers of the provisional "
government or any annexationist that the queen surrendered 
otherwise than as stated in her protest. 

"In his dispatch to Mr. Foster of January 18, describing the "
"so-called revolution, Mr. Stevens says: "

The Committee of Public Safety forthwith took possession 
"of the government buildings, archives, and treasury, and installed "



750 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

the provisional government at the head of the respective depart 
"ments. This being accomplished fact, I promptly recognized the "
provisional government as the de facto government of the Hawaiian 
"Islands."" "

In Secretary Foster s communication of February 15 to the 
"President, laying before him the treaty of annexation with a view "
"to obtaining the advice and consent of the Senate thereto, he says : "

At the time the provisional government took possession of 
the government building no troops or officers of the United States 
were present or took any part whatever in the proceedings. No 
public recognition was accorded to the provisional government 
"by the United States minister until after the queen s abdication, "
and when they were in effective possession of the government 
"building, the archives, the treasury, the barracks, the police "
"station, and all the potential machinery of the government."" "

Similar language is found in an official letter addressed to 
Secretary Foster on February 3 by the special commissioners 
sent to Washington by the provisional government to negotiate 
a treaty of annexation. 

"These statements are utterly at variance with the evidence, "
"documentary and oral, contained in Mr. Blount s reports. They "
are contradicted by declarations and letters of President Dole 
and other annexationists and by Mr. Stevens s own verbal admis 
sions to Mr. Blount. /.The provisional government was recognized 
"when it had little other than a paper existence, and when the "
legitimate government was in full possession and control of the 
"palace, the barracks, and the police station. Mr. Stevens s well- "
known hostility and the threatening presence of the force landed 
from the Boston was all that could then have excited serious 
"apprehension in the minds of the queen, her officers, and loyal "
supporters. 

It is fair to say that Secretary Foster s statements were based 
upon information which he had received from Mr. Stevens and 
"the special commissioners, but I am unable to see that they were "
"deceived. The troops were landed, not to protect American life "
"and property, but to aid in overthrowing the existing government. "
Their very presence implied coercive measures against it. 

"In a statement given to Mr. Blount by Admiral Skerrett, the "
"ranking naval officer at Honolulu, he says: "



HAWAII 751 

If the troops were landed simply to protect American citizens 
"and interests, they were badly stationed in Arion Hall, but if "
the intention was to aid the provisional government they were 
"wisely stationed."" "

This hall was so situated that the troops in it easily com 
"manded the government building, and the proclamation was "
read under the protection of American guns. At an early stage 
"of the movement, if not at the beginning, Air. Stevens promised "
the annexationists that as soon as they obtained possession of 
the government building and there read a proclamation of the 
"character above referred to, he would at once recognize them as "
"the de facto government, and support them by landing a force from "
"our warship then in the harbor, and he kept the promise. This "
"assurance was the inspiration of the movement, and without it "
the annexationists would not have exposed themselves to the con 
sequences of failure. They relied upon no military force of their 
"own, for they had none worthy of the name. The provisional "
government was established by the action of the American min 
ister and the presence of the troops landed from the Boston and 
its continued existence is due to the belief of the Hawaiians that 
"if they made an effort to overthrow it, they would encounter the "
armed forces of the United States. 

The earnest appeals to the American minister for military 
"protection by the officers of that government, after it had been "
"recognized, show the utter absurdity of the claim that it was "
established by a successful revolution of the people of the Islands. 
Those appeals were a confession by the men who made them of 
"their weakness and timidity. Courageous men, conscious of "
"their strength and the justice of their cause, do not thus act. It "
"is not now claimed that a majority of the people, having the right "
"to vote under the constitution of 1887, ever favored the existing "
authority or annexation to this or any other country. They 
earnestly desire that the government of their choice shall be 
restored and its independence respected. 

Mr. Blount states that while at Honolulu he did not meet a 
single annexationist who expressed willingness to submit the 
"question to a vote of the people, nor did he talk with one on that "
subject who did not insist that if the Islands were annexed suffrage 
should be so restricted as to give complete control to foreigners 
48



752 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

or whites. Representative annexationists have repeatedly made 
similar statements to the undersigned. 

The government of Hawaii surrendered its authority under a 
"threat of war, until such time only as the government of the "
"United States, upon the facts being presented to it, should rein "
"state the constitutional sovereign, and the provisional govern "
"ment was created, to exist until terms of union with the United "
States of America have been negotiated and agreed upon. A 
"careful consideration of the facts will, I think, convince you "
that the treaty which was withdrawn from the Senate for 
further consideration should not be resubmitted for its action 
thereon. 

Should not the great wrong done to a feeble but independent 
State by an abuse of the authority of the United States be undone 
by restoring the legitimate government Anything short of that 
"will not, I respectfully submit, satisfy the demands of justice. "

Can the United States consistently insist that other nations 
shall respect the independence of Hawaii while not respecting it 
themselves? Our government was the first to recognize the 
independence of the Islands and it should be the last to acquire 
sovereignty over them by force and fraud. 

"Respectfully submitted, "

W. Q. GRESHAM. 

The instructions to Albert S. Willis our minister to 
"Honolulu, who was just starting Judge Landis, who was "
"then private secretary to the Secretary of State, says were "
"dictated without a break, and, when transcribed in long "
"hand, did not require a verbal change. They were drawn "
immediately following a cabinet meeting at which it had 
been decided to make public the preceding letter of the 
Secretary of State to the President. The instructions to 
Minister Willis did not come out until later. 

(Confidential) 
"DEPARTMENT OF STATE, WASHINGTON, D. C. "

"October 18, 1893. "

SIR: Supplementing the general instructions which you have 
"received with regard to your official duties, it is necessary to "



HAWAII 733 

"communicate to you, in confidence, special instructions for your "
guidance in so far as concerns the relation of the government of 
the United States toward the dc facto government of the Hawaiian 
Islands. 

The President deemed it his duty to withdraw from the Senate 
the treaty of annexation which has been signed by the Secretary 
"of State and the agents of the provisional government, and to "
dispatch a trusted representative to Hawaii to investigate impar 
tially the causes of the so-called revolution and ascertain and 
report the true situation in those islands. This information was 
needed the better to enable the President to discharge a delicate 
and important public duty. 

"The instructions given to Mr. Blount, of which you are fur "
"nished with a copy, point out a line of conduct to be observed by "
"him in his official and personal relations on the Islands, by which "
you will be guided so far as they are applicable and not incon 
sistent with what is herein contained. 

It remains to acquaint you with the President s conclusions 
upon the facts embodied in Mr. Blount s reports and to direct 
your course in accordance therewith. 

The provisional government was not established by the Ha 
"waiian people, or with their consent or acquiescence, nor has it "
since existed with their consent. The queen refused to surrender 
her powers to the provisional government until convinced that 
the minister of the United States had recognized it as the de facto 
"authority, and would support and defend it with the military "
"force of the United States, and that resistance would precipitate "
a bloody conflict with that force. She was advised and assured 
by her ministers and by leaders of the movement for the over 
"throw of her government, that if she surrendered under protest "
her case would afterwards be fairly considered by the President 
of the United States. The queen finally wisely yielded to the 
"armed forces of the United States then quartered in Honolulu, "
"relying upon the good faith and honor of the President, when "
"informed of what had occurred, to undo the action of the minister "
and reinstate her and the authority which she claimed as the 
constitutional sovereign of the Hawaiian Islands. 

"After the patient examination of Air. Blount s reports, the "
"President is satisfied that the movement against the queen, if "



754 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"not instigated, was encouraged and supported by the represen "
tative of this government at Honolulu; that he promised in ad 
vance to aid her enemies in an effort to overthrow the Hawaiian 
government and set up by force a new government in its place; 
and that he kept his promise by causing a detachment of troops 
"to be landed from the Boston on the i6th of January, and by "
recognizing the provisional government the next day when it 
was too feeble to defend itself and while the constitutional govern 
ment was able successfully to maintain its authority against any 
threatening force other than that of the United States already 
landed. 

The President has therefore determined that he will not send 
back to the Senate for its action thereon the treaty which he 
withdrew from that body for further consideration on the gth 
day of March last. 

On your arrival at Honolulu you will take advantage of an 
"early opportunity to inform the queen of this determination, "
making known to her the President s sincere regret that the 
reprehensible conduct of the American minister and the un 
authorized presence on land of a military force of the United 
"States obliged her to surrender her sovereignty, for the time "
"being, and rely on the justice of this government to undo the "
flagrant wrong. 

"You will, however, at the same time inform the queen that, "
"when reinstated, the President expects that she will pursue a "
magnanimous course by granting full amnesty to all who partici 
"pated in the movement against her, including persons who are, "
"or have been, officially or otherwise, connected with the pro "
"visional government, depriving them of no right or privilege which "
they enjoyed before the so-called revolution. All obligations 
created by the provisional government in due course of adminis 
tration should be assumed. 

Having secured the queen s agreement to pursue this wise 
"and humane policy, which it is believed you will speedily obtain, "
you will then advise the executive of the provisional government 
and his ministers of the President s determination of the question 
"which their action and that of the queen devolved upon him, and "
that they are expected promptly to relinquish to her her constitu 
tional authority. 



HAWAII 755 

Should the queen decline to pursue the liberal course sug 
"gested, or should the provisional government refuse to abide by "
"the President s decision, you will report the facts and await further "
directions. 

In carrying out these general instructions you will be guided 
largely by your own good judgment in dealing with the delicate 
situation. 

"I am, Sir, "

"Your obedient servant, "
HON. ALBERT S. WILLIS. W. 0. GRESHAM. 

"The publication of the letter of October 18, as outlining "
the policy of the administration for it was anticipated 
"that Mr. Cleveland would approve it, as he did in his special "
message to Congress two months later riveted the atten 
tion of the entire country on Hawaii. The criticisms broke 
"forth afresh. Again my husband enjoyed the saying, that "
"Judge Gresham is no diplomat. "" His letter to the Presi "
dent is not a State paper but that of a judge of a court 
"after hearing a cause between two parties."" It was thus "
he intended it and he believed there was such a thing as 
"public morality, that ""right and justice"" should govern "
"the conduct of nations the same as that of individuals, "
although there was no machinery except force known to 
international law to control the former. The fear was 
abroad in the land that the Secretary of State would use 
the army and navy to put the queen back on her throne. 
It would not have been an act of war to restore the 
queen under the circumstances. And had she promptly 
"responded to his advice, the report to Congress would have "
been that she had been restored. Her hesitancy to agree 
"to amnesty, ""bloodthirstiness"" it was called, made Mr. "
"Cleveland timid about acting, instead, he. referred the "
"matter to Congress. To restore her by force, it was argued, "
"would be an act of war that Congress alone could authorize, "
"but if so, this power, the Secretary of State believed and "
"argued, Congress should use. "



756 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"From his home in Augusta, Maine, ex-Minister John "
L. Stevens undertook to answer the statement and con 
clusions of the letter of October 18. He showed his base 
"ness when he asserted that the queen was immoral, as a "
reason for dethroning her. The report of Mr. Blount 
asserted that this was not true. No reference would be 
made here to Liliuokalani s private character but for the 
"fact that men of long diplomatic training, like Robert R. "
Hitt of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of 
"Representatives, Senator Lodge, and others, used these "
assertions of Minister Stevens to prejudice her case before 
the American people. 

"One day at luncheon in the Arlington Hotel, former "
Senator Edmunds joined my husband and myself. In the 
Arthur administration my husband had advised President 
"Arthur, when it seemed that he could not be nominated, to "
take his forces to Senator Edmunds. He and Senator 
Edmunds had always been friends. Edmunds came to Mr. 
"Gresham as a friend, and said that when he was in the "
"Senate and on the Foreign Affairs Committee, if there was "
any information in the possession of the State Department 
"which it would not be advisable to make public, upon the "
representations of the Secretary of State to that effect to 
"the Committee on Foreign Relations, the request for the "
"information would not be pressed, that the information, if "
"of a confidential nature, could be disclosed to the com "
mittee and that that confidence would be observed. 
"Now, said ex-Senator Edmunds, ""if you will take the "
Foreign Affairs Committee into your confidence and there 
"is anything that should not be made public, you can rely "
"upon its members observing confidence."" "

After the luncheon was over and Senator Edmunds had 
"left, Mr. Gresham said, ""Senator Edmunds may be advising "
"me in good faith, but he is a most bitter partisan, and the "
"fact is, the telegrams that Senator Lodge and others de "
"sire, as they well know, contain statements reflecting on the "



HAWAII 757 

character of the Hawaiian queen as a woman. The pur 
pose of the men in the Senate who are pressing for the 
production of these telegrams is unfairly to influence the 
public mind by statements that Minister Stevens should 
"never have put in his telegrams, statements that Blount s "
"report shows there was no basis for making."" Then, after "
"a pause, ""They will never get these telegrams."" The "
"pressure continued great, but the telegrams never were "
"produced. Afraid of nothing but sin, as Henry Watterson "
"said, my husband did not believe that the weakness and "
"frailties of a woman; even if they existed, should be made "
"the basis for dethroning her, and he was willing to stand "
"all the odium and abuse that could be heaped upon him, "
even by many whose own private morals were not above 
reproach. 

"Before Congress met, my husband believed that the "
"best thought and conscience of the nation were with him, "
"for he had the support of publicists like Henry Watterson, "
"Horace White, Carl Schurz, then editor of Harper s Weekly, "
and men like ex-Secretary of the Treasury Benjamin H. 
"Bristow and Honorable John E. Lamb, of Terre Haute, "
"Indiana, still a young man who had served in Congress "
"as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and "
had been Senator Voorhees law partner. Up on public 
"questions with the best of them, and against imperialism "
"from the beginning, Lamb s influence with Senator Voor "
"hees and the other Indiana senator, Turpie, was to use "
"one of Mr. Lincoln s phrases ""most helpful."" Senator "
"Turpie was a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, "
"and while he was for annexation, he had scruples. The "
letters from the common people voiced their approval. 

"It was after the Blount report had been received, and "
analyzed as only a man long trained in marshaling appar 
"ently conflicting testimony can do, that on the 24th day "
"of September, 1893, Carl Schurz, after stating he had "
"opened up against the new policy of imperialism, wrote: "



758 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

I thank you very much for the confidential communication 
you make to me in your letter of the i4th inst. and appreciate 
it highly. You can of course depend on my discretion. The 
position you indicate as yours with regard to the Hawaiian busi 
"ness is unquestionably the correct one. It will, however, be a "
very delicate task completely to undo the mischief that has been 
done. You are no doubt aware of the demagogic outcry bound 
"to assail every act of justice and good policy in this matter, but "
I am glad to know that nothing of the kind will frighten you. 

"At this time the venerable Judge M. J. Bundy, one of "
"the founders of the Republican party, my husband s friend "
"and counselor in the Indiana legislature in 1861, wrote from "
"Newcastle, Indiana, the warning that ""the Democratic "
"party has always been a party of annexation and grab, and "
"has never had any scruples as to how they got it."" But "
there was a new order of men and measures. The Secre 
tary of State had the practical politician the man of the 
"machine behind him as well as the sentimentalist, the "
"publicist, and the statesman. "

"At this time, before Congress met, Thomas Taggart, "
"who had already won his spurs in many ""local affairs"" and "
who subsequently became a United States senator and then 
chairman of the Indiana Democratic State Central Com 
"mittee, sent word to Judge Gresham that he approved of "
"the proposed Hawaiian policy, and that he believed in a "
great and powerful nation protecting instead of pulling 
down a w r eak and helpless one. Mr. Taggart was speaking 
"from his heart, and that disposition of his to aid the weak "
"and helpless, and, what is more, deriving pleasure in grati "
"fying it, has rightly contributed to his power and influence. "

And there were men like Attorney- General Olney who 
questioned the policy of the course to be pursued. Major 
"Bluford Wilson, through wiiom Secretary of State Gresham "
"had made public his purpose to vote for G rover Cleveland, "
came to Washington to urge that the acquisition of the 
"Hawaiian Islands be accepted as an accomplished faet, "



HAWAII 759 

regardless of what had happened and how it had been 
brought about. 

Instead of Mr. Cleveland regarding and treating his 
"cabinet ministers as mere clerks, as it was charged, the "
contrary was true. He gave a man his confidence and gen 
erally w 7 ent with him to the logic of his conclusions. It was 
Mr. Cleveland \vho first yielded to my husband s argument 
that nothing short of the restoration of the queen immoral 
"though she might be, as the Republicans claimed would "
"be in keeping with justice and international morality, and "
then up to a certain point he supported it with all his 
personal force and official power. 

"John T. Morgan, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs "
"Committee of the United States Senate, was an imperialist, "
"an annexationist, a high protectionist, and an enemy of "
the Cleveland administration from start to finish. Senator 
"George F. Gray, the next ranking member on the committee, "
was an administration man of the finest ability and at 
"tainments, but, to use Ambassador Bayard s expression, he "
would not press the contest. The Secretary of State early 
"threw out his lines for Senator George G. Vest of Missouri, "
"who answered: ""While I am persona non grata at the White "
"House, / will conic to the State Department. I am your friend "
"now as I have always been."" He came and was primed "
especially for Senator George F. Hoar of Massachusetts. 
"Missouri never entirely got out of the Union, but as far as "
it w r ent George G. Vest went with it and represented it in 
"the Confederate Congress. At this time, 1893, long a mem "
"ber of the United States Senate, and one of its ablest de "
"baters, he was always ready for Senator Hoar. He would "
know in advance what Senator Hoar s position would be 
and would write by special messenger to my husband for 
data if he or some other Senator needed it. The forces 
of the State Department never failed to supply him with 
the data or precedents he wanted. Professor John Bassett 
"Moore was a mine of information, and whatever may be "



760 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

said about some of the judicial judgments of Kenesaw M. 
"Landis, his energy and ability to work and mix was pro "
"digious, and with Secretary Gresham to guide, he made "
no mistakes. Senator Vest s hatred of Grover Cleveland 
was only equaled by the delight he took in exposing and 
ridiculing some of the pretensions of New England to supe 
"rior solicitude for the inferior races. ""The Pilgrims fell "
"on their knees and then on the Aborigines."" "

But it was Senator Roger Q. Mills of Texas who lived up 
to the sound morality of the situation to which Attorney- 
General Olney would not go. Had Wendell Phillips 1 been 
"alive he could have truthfully declared, ""I would rather "
"have been born in Texas than Massachusetts."" To Mr. "
Mills my husband talked and wrote his views. 

Finally the heat of the debate and the position of the 
provisional government wearied Senator Hoar of the con 
flict. He had a good heart. Privately he sent my husband 
word he would quit and he did. Afterwards he made him 
self famous by his speeches in opposition to the purchase 
of the Philippines. And the pressing home of the morals 
of the position of the Cleveland administration in the 
"Hawaiian debate to men of conscience like George F. Hoar, "
determined his position and that of many others when it 
came to the adoption of a permanent colonial policy in the 
Philippines. 

It won back the support and confidence of men like 
"William E. Mason of Illinois, who was one of Walter Q. "
Gresham s most loyal and efficient supporters in the 1888 
"Convention, and who had most bitterly resented the vote "
for Grover Cleveland. To United States Senator Mason it 
"was due, more than any other man, that the United States "
kept faith with Cuba. 

"November 16, Mr. Willis had an interview alone with "
the queen in which he acquainted her with his instructions 
to restore her provided she would accord complete amnesty 
to the members of the provisional government and accept 

iSee Introduction; also pages 53 and 103. 



HAWAII 761 

"the validity of all its official acts. This she refused to do, "
because she said the constitution required the death penalty 
in all cases of treason. 

"That day he made a full report of the interview, includ "
"ing a stenographic copy, and sent the following telegram: "
Views of the first party so extreme as to require further 
"instructions. "" "

This telegram was received in Washington on Novem 
ber 24. The letter had not yet arrived and did not arrive 
until December 16. At this time there was no cable be 
tween Honolulu and San Francisco. Mr. Willis was able 
"to get his telegram on the steamer leaving the i6th, but "
"not his letter. The telegram reached Washington the 24th, "
and was answered briefly that day as follows: 

The brevity and uncertainty of your telegrams are embar 
rassing. You will insist upon amnesty and recognition of the 
obligations of the provisional government as essential conditions 
of restoration. All interests will be promoted by prompt action. 

"Then, on December 3, the following dispatch was sent "
to Mr. Willis : 

Your dispatch which was answered by steamer of the 25th 
of November seems to call for additional instructions. Should 
"the queen refuse assent to the written conditions, you will at once "
"inform her that the President will cease interposition in her behalf, "
and that while he deems it his duty to endeavor to restore to the 
"sovereign the constitutional government of the Islands, his further "
efforts in that direction will depend upon the queen s unqualified 
agreement that all obligations created by the provisional govern 
ment in a proper course of administration shall be assumed and 
upon such pledges by her as will prevent the adoption of any 
measures of prescription or punishment for what has been done in 
the past by those setting up or supporting the provisional govern 
ment. 

Should the queen ask whether if she accedes to these conditions 
active steps will be taken by the United States to effect her resto 
"ration or to maintain her authority thereafter, you will say the "
President cannot use force without the authority of Congress. 



762 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

Should the queen accept conditions and the provisional govern 
"ment refuse to surrender, you will be governed by previous instruc "
tions. If the provisional government asks whether the United 
States will hold the queen to a fulfillment of the stipulated con 
"ditions, you will say, the President acting under the dictates of "
"honor and duty as he has done in endeavoring to effect restoration, "
will do all in his constitutional power to cause the observance of 
the conditions he has imposed. 

"In his annual message of December 4, 1893, Mr. Cleve "
land promised he would send to Congress later a special 
message on the situation in Hawaii. Meanwhile Mr. Willis s 
"letter of November 16 arrived, and on December 18 this "
special message went to Congress: 

Though I am not able now to report a definite change in the 
"actual situation, I am convinced that the difficulties lately "
created both here and in Hawaii are now standing in the way 
"of solution through executive action of the problem presented, "
and render it proper and expedient that the matter should be 
"referred to the broader authority and discretion of Congress, with "
a full explanation of the endeavor thus far made to deal with the 
emergency and a statement of the considerations which have 
governed my action. 

"The conditions suggested, as the instructions show, contem "
plate a general amnesty to those concerned in setting up the 
"provisional government, and a recognition of all its bona fide "
"acts and obligations. In short, they require that the past should "
"be buried, and that the restored government should resume its "
authority as if its continuity had not been interrupted. These 
"conditions have not proved acceptable to the queen, and though "
"she had been informed that they will be insisted upon, and that "
"unless acceded to, the efforts of the President to aid in the resto "
"ration of her government will cease, I have not thus far learned "
that she is willing to yield them her acquiescence. The check 
which my plans have encountered has prevented their presenta 
"tion to the members of the provisional government, while unfor "
tunate public misrepresentation of the situation and exaggerated 
statements of the sentiments of our people have obviously injured 
the prospects of successful executive mediation. 



HAWAII 763 

"In the next place, upon the face of the papers submitted with "
"the treaty, it clearly appeared that there was an open and unde "
termined issue of facts of the most vital importance. The message 
"of the President (February 15, 1803) accompanying the treaty "
"declared that the ""overthrow of the monarchy was not in any "
"way promoted by this government."" But a protest also accom "
panied this treaty signed by the queen and her ministers at the 
"time she made way for the provisional government, which explic "
itly stated that she yielded to the superior force of the United 
"States, whose minister had caused United States troops to be "
landed at Honolulu and /declared that he would support such 
provisional government. 

The truth or falsity of this protest was surely of the first 
"importance, yet the truth or falsity of the protest had not been "
investigated. 

In the midst of the so-called revolution the Committee of 
Public Safety addressed Minister Stevens a note in which they 
"said, ""We are unable to protect ourselves without aid and there "
"fore pray for the protection of the United States force s."" When "
"this note was written, the committee, so far as it appears, had "
neither a man or a gun at their command. 

"A little further along he said: ""Indeed, the representatives "
of that government say that the people of Hawaii are unfit for 
popular government and frankly avow that they can best be 
"ruled by arbitrary or despotic power."" "

Expressions or sentences like the following in the mes 
"sage, it was said at the time, were the utterances of a judge "
or chancellor : 

Our country was in danger of occupying the position of hav 
ing actually set up a temporary government on foreign soil for 
the purpose of acquiring through that agency territory which we 
had wrongfully put in its possession. The control of both sides 
of a bargain acquired in such a manner is called by a familiar 
and unpleasant name when found in private transactions. 

I mistake the American people if they favor the odious doctrine 
that there is no such thing as international morality. 

"The law of nations is founded upon reason and justice, and the "
rules of conduct governing individual relations between citizens 



764 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

or subjects of a civilized State are equally applicable as between 
enlightened nations. The consideration that international law 
"is without a court for its enforcement, and that obedience to its "
commands practically depends upon good faith instead of upon 
"the mandate of a superior tribunal, only gives additional sanction "
to the law itself and brands any deliberate infraction of it not 
merely as a wrong but as a disgrace. A man of true honor protects 
"the unwritten word which binds his conscience more scrupulously, "
"if possible, than he does the bond, a breach of which subjects him "
to legal liabilities: and the United States in aiming to maintain 
itself as one of the most enlightened of nations would do its citi 
zens gross injustice if it applied to its international relations any 
other than a high standard of honor and morality. On that 
ground the United States cannot be properly put in the position 
of countenancing a wrong after its commission any more than in 
that of consenting to it in advance. On that ground it cannot 
allow itself to refuse to redress an injury inflicted through an 
abuse of power by officers clothed with its authority and wearing 
"its uniforms: and on the same ground, if a feeble but friendly "
State is in danger of being robbed of its independence and sover 
"eignty by a misuse of the name and power of the United States, "
the United States cannot fail to vindicate its honor and its sense 
of justice by an earnest effort to make all possible reparation. 

"Intense was the interest when this message was read, "
and bitter the opposition of the Democrats in the Senate 
to the request of Senator W. E. Chandler of New Hamp 
shire for the immediate reading of the Secretary of State s 
"instructions to Mr. Willis, those of October 18, November "
"25, and December 3, 1893. For a half day the debate went "
on. Finally Senator Voorhees threw his weight against the 
"attempt to gain a partisan advantage, contrary to the uni "
"form custom of the Senate, by allowing only part of the "
public documents that accompanied a message to be read. 
"Then Senator Chandler, who, we have already shown, had "
revealed to my husband his sympathy for the course of the 
administration and who actually knew what was in these 
"dispatches, declared that he was no partisan and proved "



HAWAII 765 

it by reminding the Senate that he had served all through 
"the special session of the summer before, under the leader "
"ship of that distinguished financier, the chairman of the "
"Finance Committee, the Senator from Indiana, in support "
ing a Democratic administration in repealing the purchasing 
clause of the Sherman Act. The humor of the situation 
"dawned on them. Unanimous consent was given, the in "
"structions were read, and one of the criticisms of the critics "
"was silenced, namely, that it had been the purpose of the "
"Secretary of State and of the President, without the con "
"sent of Congress, to use force in restoring the queen. "

Still the criticism was made that the Secretary of State 
had all but threatened to make war on the provisional 
government; and that instead of answering the inquiry of 
the representative of the provisional government when the 
latter called at the State Department (prefacing the question 
that that government could not and would not undertake 
"to resist the forces of the United States) , as to whether the "
executive branch of the government of the United States 
"proposed to use the army and navy to restore the queen, "
"the Secretary of State replied, ""I commend to you a study "
"of the Constitution and laws of the United States."" The "
connection was manifested when Senator Morgan of Ala 
bama supported the resolution (which did not pass) of 
"Senator Fry of Maine that, pending the investigation of "
"the situation in Hawaii, there should be no interference on "
the part of the government of the United States by moral or 
"physical force for the restoration of Liliuokalani. Indeed, "
"as Senator Mills remarked in the Senate, ""Politics makes "
"strange bedfellows."" Senator Morgan was virulent and vin "
"dictive toward Mr. Cleveland and the Secretary of State, "
"and on one occasion, it was said, a meeting of the Foreign "
Affairs Committee of the Senate was suddenly adjourned 
to prevent the chairman of that committee from coming to 
blows with the Secretary of State. 

Little progress did Senator Morgan ever make with his 



766 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

bill for the construction of the Nicaraguan Canal. Senator 
Turpie made an elaborate argument against it and the 
administration went to the people of Alabama and brought 
him to his knees. 

"On December 19, 1893. Mr. Willis secured the queen s "
written assent to the required conditions and called on the 
"provisional government and made known his instructions, "
acquainted it that he had the queen s written guaranty of 
amnesty and assumption of all the acts of the provisional 
"government in the ordinary course of administration, and "
requested it to relinquish to the queen her government. 

It was through one of her former ministers and the 
British minister to Hawaii that the queen was prevailed 
on to agree to the terms our government demanded be 
fore restoring her. UThe action of the British minister in 
this affair shows the absurdity of the claim of the jingoists 
that Great Britain was scheming to secure the Islands. 
Afterwards Liliuokalani complained that her mistake in 
refusing the conditions offered in the first instance was that 
"she was without any competent adviser, and that her long "
silence was due to the fact that Minister Willis had cautioned 
her to keep inviolably secret the proposition he had made 
"to her, which she had done until he advised her to take "
counsel of some one or two of her friends. This action was 
after Mr. Willis received the telegrams of November 25 
and December 3. Mr. Willis cautioned silence on her part 
because he said he feared that a premature publication of 
his plans might result in Liliuokalani s assassination. Cer 
"tain it is that she showed a man s ability to keep a secret, "
"also courage both moral and physical of the highest order, "
"even if her first impulses, which my husband did not think "
"should have been counted against her, were not humane. "

Afterwards she complained that the men who were 
waging the unequal contest against her were given every 
opportunity to counsel and advise before making an answer. 
She refused to be bought off by her enemies in Hawaii or 



HAWAII 767 

"in the United States; that is, to accept any of the crown "
lands in Hawaii or any money compensation from the United 
States. So she made good her protest to the last. 

The answer of the provisional government was handed 
"to Mr. Willis December 23, 1893. It reached Washington "
"January 12, 1894, was answered that day, and was sent "
"to the Senate and House January 13, together w T ith all "
correspondence between Mr. Willis and the queen and the 
"provisional government from November 16, 1893. The "
only document withheld was Mr. Stevens s dispatch No. 70 
"to Mr. Elaine, and that never was produced. "

And now for the position of the provisional government 
"through its president, who signed himself, ""Sanford B. Dole, "
"Minister of Foreign Affairs."" "

My position is briefly this: If the American forces illegally 
"assisted the revolutionists in the provisional government, that "
government is not responsible for their wrong-doing. It was 
purely a private matter for discipline between the United States 
"government and its own officers. There is, I submit, no prece "
dent in international law for the theory that such action of the 
American troops has conferred upon the United States authority 
"over the officials of this government. Should it be true, as you "
"have suggested, that the American government made itself re "
"sponsible to the queen, who, it is alleged, lost her throne through "
"such action, that is not a matter for me to discuss, except to submit "
"that if such be the case, it is a matter for the American govern "
"ment and her to settle between them. This government, a recog "
"nized sovereign power, equal in authority with the United States "
"government and enjoying domestic relations with it, cannot be "
destroyed by it for the sake of discharging its obligations to 
the ex-queen. . . . 

"Upon these grounds [the foregoing, and the denial that the pro "
visional government had agreed that the President of the United 
"States should arbitrate the differences between it and the queen], "
"Mr. Minister, in behalf of my government, I respectfully pro "
test against the usurpation of its authority as suggested by the 
language of your communication. 
49



768 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

Such ingenuous language from the son of a missionary 
"born in Honolulu but educated at Williams College, and "
"his legal education acquired in a Boston law office, while it "
"might, as it did, receive the sanction of the narrow technical "
"lawyer, shocked the judicial conscience. From the chan "
"cery side swift work would have been made of such ""pre "
"tenses."" But the question then was before Congress, whose "
"power was complete and duty plain in the premises, as both "
President Cleveland and the Secretary of State stated in 
"their answer to Mr. Willis, which was then sent to Congress "
along with Mr. Dole s communication to Mr. Willis. 

The President entertains a different view of his responsibility 
and duty limited to dealing with our own unfaithful officials and 
that he can take no steps looking to the correction of the wrong 
done. The subversion of the Hawaiian government by an abuse of 
the authority of the United States was in plain violation of inter 
national law. It required the President to disavow and condemn 
"the act of our offending officials, and within the limits of his con "
stitutional power to endeavor to restore the lawful authority. 

It was this language and conduct in keeping with it that 
silenced the criticisms of the senior Senator from Massa 
"chusetts on the Cleveland administration, although it then "
failed to elevate him to the support of its honorable and 
"high moral position, a position which Senator Hoar took "
"five years later, and a position which I venture will be the "
position of the American people and this government in 
the future. 

This language and subsequent conduct explains why 
"Hawaii, instead of being a State, as was originally con "
"templated, is now not even under a territorial government "
"popular in form; that is, that it never can be a State of "
this Union. Its government is like that of the District of 
"Columbia, under a governor appointed by the President "
of the United States. In this governor is centered all 
executive and much of legislative power. The judges are 
appointed by the President. 



HAWAII 769 

"June 1 6, 1897, a treaty of annexation between the United "
States and the Republie was sent to the Senate. The oli 
garchy after its failure to secure annexation under President 
"Cleveland s administration, changed its form and name to "
that of the Republic of Hawaii. But the treaty failing to 
"receive the constitutional two-thirds vote of the Senate, "
annexation was brought about by a joint resolution of 
both Houses which only required a majority vote not the 
way contemplated by the framers of the constitution for 
the- annexation. Senator Hoar was not enthusiastic in the 
acquisition for he foresaw it meant the taking over of the 
Philippines and imperialism. 

"To show the intensity of the feeling, Isador Raynor, "
"a member of Congress from Maryland, from his home in "
"Baltimore January i, 1894, wrote to the Secretary of State "
"for certain data, and requesting that he ask the Speaker to "
"recognize him immediately following James B. McCreary, "
"chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. ""We will,"" "
"said Mr. Raynor, ""set aside the debate on the tariff and "
debate and sustain the report of the Foreign Affairs Com 
"mittee, approving the action of the administration and con "
"demning that of Minister Stevens."" The debate began in "
"the House February 2 and lasted until February 7, with a "
Sunday intervening. 

"McCreary of Kentucky, Raynor of Maryland, Money of "
"Mississippi, Patterson of Tennessee, General ""Joe"" Wheeler "
"of Alabama, Gates of Alabama, McDonald of Illinois, Gen "
"eral Black of Illinois, Hall of Minnesota, Outhwaite of Ohio, "
"Everett and Hooker of Mississippi, sustained the admin "
"istration, while Robert R. Hitt led off against it, followed "
"by these Republicans : Blair of New Hampshire, Draper and "
"Morse of Massachusetts, Boutelle of Maine, Van Voorhis "
"of New York, Post of Illinois, Lacy of Michigan, Storer "
"of Ohio, and Hepburn of Iowa. "

The queen s first refusal to grant amnesty lost her the 



770 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"support of Congress, but the critics of the administration "
"were not spared. Said DeSota Money, ""I also heartily "
endorse his [Hitt s] proposition that the white race shall 
and ought to be dominant wherever on the face of the 
"globe they assert their ascendency."" But Mississippi chi "
valry was above even wantonly attacking a colored woman s 
"character, so he condemned the attack of Messrs Stevens "
and Hitt on the queen s personal character and put this 
"question to Mr. Hitt: ""With how many courts of Europe "
would we have diplomatic relations if we were to go into 
"the private character of their rulers?"" "

"Then by a vote of 177 yeas to 78 nays, 96 present but not "
"voting, the resolution as reported by Mr. McCreary of the "
"Foreign Affairs Committee was adopted, that the action "
of the United States minister in employing the United 
"States naval forces, and in illegally aiding in overthrowing "
the constitutional government of the Hawaiian Islands and 
"setting up in its place a provisional government, not repub "
lican in form and in opposition to the will of the majority 
"of the people, was contrary to the traditions of our Republic "
"and the spirit of our Constitution, and should be and is "
condemned. 

In the Senate the administration did not fare quite so 
"well, for Senator Morgan did all he could to embarrass it, "
but in the end he was forced to indorse its action. 

"The debate continued in the Senate until February, "
"1895. And in the meantime ""that free trade measure,"" "
"the Wilson Bill, which the Sugar Trust and the New Eng "
"land Senators, led by Senator Aldrich, had such a hand in "
"revamping in the Senate, had passed. "

Senator Mills of Texas did not need any coaching from 
"start to finish, but many of his facts and arguments were "
furnished him by the Secretary of State. I still hold the 
copies of the letters that were written to the Texas Senator. 

He read from the Republican party platform of 1856: 



HAWAII 771 

"Resolved, That the highwayman s plea that ""might makes right,"" "
"embodied in the Ostend circular, was in every respect unworthy "
"of American diplomacy, and would bring shame and dishonor up "
on any government or people that gave it their sanction. 

The Republicans declared that the proposal to seize 
"Cuba was the doctrine of the highwayman, and yet, when "
the armed forces of the United States seized the Hawaiian 
"Islands, put the United States flag over them and declared "
"a protectorate over them, making the United States respon "
"sible for them, asserted that that was a wise policy, a highly "
moral and highly Christian policy. 

Senators Lodge and Hoar had made much of the letter 
of credence of Mr. Willis in which President Dole of the 
provisional republic was addressed by President Cleveland 
"as his ""Great and Good Friend."" Senator Mills rung the "
"changes on President Harrison s letter to his ""Great and "
"Good Friend"" Liliuokalani, accrediting Minister Stevens to "
"her and commending him to her ""confidence."" "

I have intrusted this gentleman to present to you this expres 
sion of my wishes and commend him to your confidence as the 
trusted agent of the government of the United States in Hawaii. 

In the full belief he will deserve the confidence and that his 
"mission will serve to draw still closer, if possible, the friendly "
"relations of the two countries, I pray God to have Your Majesty "
"in His wise keeping. Your Good Friend, "

BENJAMIN HARRISON. 

"The queen did confide in him, and he as the ambassador "
and representative of the government of the United States 
used the armed power of this country to destroy an innocent 
and helpless people in order that New England corpora 
"tions (forty of them) might get possession of their property, "
"owoi their sugar plantations, and wring out of the pockets "
of the American people a bounty which the sugar corpo 
"rations have received to the amount of more than $51,000,- "
ooo since the treaty was made. This was done by New 



772 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

England and other corporations of the United States 
mostly from the section of the country where its great 
capital is massed. 

The Queen s crime (Mr. Mills said) was wanting the land for 
"her own people. Mr. President, that poor woman was told in "
"her agonies and while surrounded by a cordon of bayonets, that "
Great Britain once restored that government when an unauthor 
ized naval officer had torn down the flag and hoisted the British 
"flag. She was asked, ""Why not rely on your good friend Ben "
jamin Harrison? Can you not rely upon the President of the 
"United States to do you justice and restore you:*"" "

"Of course, Senator Mills was for restoring the status quo. "

The Queen of the Hawaiian Islands was the representative 
"of the people of the Hawaiian Islands. Among all the barbaric, "
"half-civilized, and savage people no such thing as popular govern "
ment is known. Popular government can exist only in the domain 
of high and exalted civilization; there must be public virtue and 
public intelligence to support a representative government spring 
ing from the consent of the governed. Rude people have what they 
"call a chief, a king, and to whom they give other titles. These "
"rulers represent them, and they are the choice of their people. "

But whether the old government of Hawaii was right or wrong 
in form is not for us to discuss: it was the government of the 
"Hawaiian Islands, and it was overthrown by the armed power of "
the United States. 

Place us back again where you found us. We are disarmed 
and you have disarmed us. 

"There was no reason, Mr. Mills contended, why the Re "
publicans should not do this. At the behest of the Sugar 
"Trust they united with England and Germany in ""selecting, "
"appointing, and maintaining"" Malietoa as king of the "
"Samoan Islands, while they deposed and kept in jail the "
"native chieftain Mataafa in the Marshall Islands, which "
"belong to Germany. This joint protectorate over Samoa, "
"Secretary of State Gresham was saying, should be dis "
"solved, and Senator Teller said that it should never have "
been entered into. 

"Continuing, Senator Mills said: "



HAWAII 773 

"I was a member of the House when Speaker Elaine, a Repub "
"lican Congress, and a Republican President received the Hawaiian "
"king, the predecessor of Liliuokalani. There was nothing said "
then against his being king. They wanted to negotiate the sugar 
treaty. New England capitalists wanted to get the sugar lands 
of the king. They have them now. Now royal rule is in the 
way. The poor painted queen had sympathy for her people: she 
"wanted homes for them, not on top of the mountains, on some of "
which Mr. Thurston says one can sit astride. She wanted some 
portion of the land which had belonged to her people centuries 
"ago, but the sugar trust wanted it also and they were more "
"powerful than the queen. Over $30,000,000 of the $75,000,000 "
of the sugar trust stock is held in New England. 

Mr. Mills criticized Mr. Cleveland for not receiving the 
"Hawaiian commissioners, who on August n, 1894, called "
on the Secretary of State and requested in writing an 
"audience with the President. ""He should have received "
them and told them that he sympathized with their people 
and regretted the wrongs done them ; that he had reported 
their case to Congress; that Congress had turned away 
"from them, as they turn away sometimes from the best "
"interests of their own people, and he was powerless to grant "
"their request."" "

"Instead of ""Access to the Conscience of the American "
"People,"" the history of their wrongs must stop in the waste "
basket of the diplomatic representative of the government 
"which our troops helped to establish, and against which "
they complain. 

"Senators Aldrich, Hale, and Fry were hurt to the quick "
by Senator Mills adverting to the unjust stories the New 
York Evening Post and other papers were publishing about 
their connection with the Sugar Trust and Hawaiian bonds 
that could be bought for twenty-five cents on the dollar. 

Only the queen s own words defeated her restoration. 
"Her ""bloodthirstiness,"" as it was called, made Mr. Cleve "
land and many of the leading Democratic Senators timid 
"about acting, that is, restoring the status quo, or the queen "



774 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"to the throne, and reporting her restoration as an accom "
plished fact. The only way to preserve society and govern 
"ment, as we understand it, my husband said, was to do "
"justice in the particular case, and he believed he could do "
"it in Lilioukalani s case, and save the lives of every one of "
her rebellious subjects. As Lord Mansfield said in the 
"Negro Case, ""We will do justice though the Heavens fall."" 1 "
Annexation was rejected but the provisional government 
was not recognized. The resolutions of the Foreign Affairs 
Committee there were several sets and many introduced 
by various Senators not members of that committee - 
were redrafted on the floor of the Senate (in which Senator 
"Vest took the lead) and were passed in the following form, "
"February 28, 1894: "

Resolved: That of right it belongs wholly to the people of the 
Hawaiian Islands to establish and maintain their own form of 
government and domestic policy: that the United States ought 
"in no wise to interfere therewith, and that any intervention in "
the political affairs of their Islands by any other government will 
be regarded as an act unfriendly to the United States. 

The population of the Hawaiian Islands at this time was 
"89,990: 15,301 Chinese, 12,360 Japanese, 8,602 Portuguese "
"(very few of whom could read and write), 1,344 British, "
"1,298 Americans, 1,034 Germans, 588 Polynesians, 227 Nor "
"wegians, 70 French, 419 scattering, and 40,622 Hawaiians and "
"half-castes. Of the Hawaiians and half-castes, 12,721 could "
"read and write. Unfitted for a popular government, they "
were happy and contented under the government of their 
"choice, their queen, asserted Senator Mills. And certainly "
an oligarchy was no better than a constitutional monarchy. 

"January 26, 1895, the Senate declared for a policy of "
non-intervention and approved President Cleveland s acts 
"in carrying it out. During the month of January, 1895, a "
feeble and unsuccessful attempt was made to overthrow the 
Hawaiian Republic. 

1 See page 38. 



HAWAII 775 

"On February 9, a message came via steamer as far as "
"San Francisco, from Minister Willis, saying that thirty-eight "
"of the rebels had been tried by a court-martial, a number "
"condemned to death, others banished, while two hundred "
remained to be tried. Notwithstanding the declaration of 
non-intervention that the Senate had passed a few days 
"before, Secretary Gresham, without waiting even to consult "
"President Cleveland, cabled Minister Willis to call on the "
officers of the Republic of Hawaii and demand a suspension 
of the execution of the condemned. A report as to the 
evidence on which the judgments w r ere based was imme 
diately transmitted to Congress. 

"In the Senate, Senator Morgan said we had adopted a "
"policy of non-intervention in Hawaii, to which he was "
"opposed, and in view of it we had no concern with their "
affairs. For himself he said he would have more respect 
for Hawaii if she shot a traitor than if she forgave him. 
But the best thing for the United States to do is to keep 
"out of this new phase of the subject."" "

But Republican Senators like Hawley and Hale vigor 
ously dissented from Mr. Morgan s policy and said that 
while the American people have thus far sympathized 
with the efforts to establish a republican form of govern 
"ment in Hawaii, there will be a speedy change if this bar "
"barous course is pursued."" "

Mr. Willis reported that it was Secretary Gresham s 
cable that saved the lives of all the condemned. 

"If the Hawaiian policy was unpopular with the jingoists, "
"it was not with the representatives of Mexico, of the Cen "
"tral and South American Republics, and with China and "
Japan. The representative European countries marveled 
at the moderation of our government and of its declining 
"to take Hawaii under the circumstances, although it was "
"recognized that in the face of the opinion of the court, as "
"was contemptuously said, there was no other conclusion "
"than that arrived at. The representatives of Mexico, the "



776 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"Central American and South American States, and China "
"took it as conclusive, as Minister Romero of Mexico said, "
that there was no design on the part of the American 
nation to aggrandize itself at the expense of its weaker 
neighbors. Every one regards the United States as our 
"friend, and the letter of October 18, 1893, the greatest "
"State paper from America on foreign relations."" 1 "

After my husband s death there was a mass meeting 
of Hawaiians at which they expressed their sympathy in 
a set of resolutions which I copy : 

"WHEREAS, Mr. Gresham, as Secretary of State, was called "
"upon to inquire into the affairs of Hawaii, owing to the wrongs "
done to our sovereign and people by representatives of the United 
States of America : and 

"WHEREAS, after a full and patient examination Mr. Gresham "
decided that our sovereign and the true people of Hawaii had been 
"wrongfully treated, and that the President and people of the "
United States ought to repair the wrongs done by the servants 
of that great people : and 

"WHEREAS, in all his acts in our behalf Mr. Gresham showed a "
high sense of justice and mercy and great courage : and 

"WHEREAS, Mr. Gresham was in no way responsible for the "
continuance of the wrongs under which we still suffer: 

"THEREFORE, we, in the hour of their bereavement, extend "
our sincere sympathy to Mrs Gresham and her children. 

1 Mr. Gresham s course in the case of Hawaii is in my opinion the most creditable act 
to himself and to his country of the long list of distinguished public services rendeied by him 
during his incumbency of the Department of State. 

It is useless to discuss whether Mr. Gresham or President Cleveland was the originator 
of that policy. It throws plenty of high honor on both of them. And from the light of 
"subsequent events Mr. Gresham deserves a great deal of credit. It is in my opinion, more "
than enough to stamp Mr. Gresham as one of the greatest statesmen of this country even 
if he had done nothing else. 

From the records it appears that Mr. Gresham originated it in his report of October 
"18, 1893, to the President, just mentioned, although it met with the most cordial approval "
"from the President in his message to Congress December 18, 1893, the date of Mr. Gresham s "
report.

part that our government played in overcoming the 
insurrection which had for its object the restoration 
"of the monarchy in Brazil, perhaps because of the stirring "
events that were contemporaneous with and succeeded 
"that incident, seems to have attracted little attention from "
historians. We heard much of it at the time. Almost 
"daily the Brazilian minister, Salvador de Mendonga, called "
at our apartments. He was a very able man and was a 
firm believer in the Monroe Doctrine. At my husband s 
instance Serior Mendonga wrote an exposition of the 
Monroe Doctrine for the newspapers. Whatever its ori

of the powerful republic to the north standing as guardian 
"of all the struggling peoples to the south, that no European "
nation might permanently occupy any part of the Western 
"Hemisphere, Canada excepted. "

777



778 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"November 15, 1889, the monarchy in Brazil was over "
thrown and a republic was established. The republic went 
"along well until September 7, 1893, when most of the Bra "
"zilian navy, under the leadership of Admiral De Mello, "
revolted. On land the republic retained its ascendancy 
under the leadership of Marshal Peixoto. The insurgents 
undertook to blockade the harbor at Rio Janeiro. Admiral 
Da Gama joined them with more ships for the avowed 
purpose of restoring the monarchy. The sympathy of the 
"British shipping interests at Rio, the activity of the mon "
"archists in Lisbon, London, and Paris, and the large sums "
"of money spent by the Due de Montpensier of Spain, the "
"head of the Bourbon family and immensely rich, made it "
a question of much concern to our government. Ambassa 
dor Bayard was in constant private correspondence as well 
as official correspondence with the Secretary of State. 

While the insurgents had not been accorded belligerent 
"rights by any of the governments of Europe, when the "
captains of eight American merchantmen of Rio appealed 
to the Secretary of the Navy for protection to enable them 
"to land their cargoes, they received answer that he was "
"without authority to instruct Captain Pickering, the Ameri "
"can naval commander, in the premises. Then complaints "
came to the State Department from W. S. Grossman &amp; 
"Brother of New York, and Isadore Strauss wrote to the head "
of the State Department vouching for Grossman &amp; Brother 
and furnishing indisputable proof of the activities of the 
Brazilian insurgents and of their attempts to purchase a 
Grecian ironclad. 

"In the answer to Mr. Strauss, Secretary Gresham wrote : "

The administration has not neglected anything necessary 
"for the protection of American interests at Rio, and I can say "
"to you in confidence, that should European powers attempt to "
"reestablish the monarchy in Brazil, the Monroe Doctrine will "
not only be asserted by the administration but maintained. I 
will not risk repeating here the instructions which have been sent 



"BRAZIL, NICARAGUA, AND CUBA 779 "

"to Mr. Bayard upon this subject. Of course, you will understand "
the importance of not letting this be made public. 

"When Rear-Admiral Stanton saluted the insurgent flag, "
he was recalled and Rear-Admiral Benham was sent in his 
"stead. Admiral Benham reached Rio January 15, 1894. "
"He had his flagship, the San Francisco, also the Newark, "
"Charleston, and Detroit, all new cruisers. What Admiral "
Benham s instructions were will be revealed by what he 
did. Meanwhile the American merchantmen at Rio were 
advised through their owners to apply to Admiral Benham 
for protection. 

With his long legislative experience and his four years at 
"the head of the State Department, Thomas F. Bayard was "
one of the most efficient representatives the United States 
ever had at the Court of St. James. In Parliament Mr. 
Gladstone stated that the English government was doing 
all within international usage to protect British interests 
"at Rio. And in Washington, Sir Julian Pauncefote was "
induced to make the announcement that the British ships 
at Rio were not to be used to sustain the revolting Brazilian 
war vessels. 

"Soon after his arrival, on January 18, Admiral Benham "
"sent word to Marshal Peixoto, president of the Brazilian "
"Republic, that he would be willing, as an individual, to "
intervene to bring the naval revolt to an honorable termi 
nation. Before an answer came from the Brazilian presi 
"dent, American ship captains complained that they were "
being fired on by Admiral Da Gama. The captain of the 
"Amy from Baltimore, loaded with flour, reported to Admiral "
Benham that it was necessary for him to get to the wharf 
"soon, as the flour would spoil in that hot climate. The "
Amy and the other American ship were being held in the 
offing by the insurgent ships. Copies of these written 
complaints Admiral Benham sent to Admiral Da Gama 
with a written communication in which he said the firing 
"on American vessels must cease, and that on the following "



780 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"day, January 28, he would convoy the schooner Amy to the "
wharf of the consignee and would sink any vessel that op 
posed the Amy s progress to the quay. As the inhabitants 
"had not been accorded belligerent rights, Admiral Benham "
said in this communication to Admiral Da Gama that the 
insurgents would be pirates if they fired on the Amy. 

"Then, in plain view of the Brazilian fleet, Admiral Ben- "
"ham ""stripped his ships for action."" On the morning of "
"the 2gth the Amy, with the Detroit on her right, in order to "
"be between her and the insurgent ships, and with the other "
"American war vessels following, started for the quay. "
"Soon the Liber dade, Da Gama s flagship, fired a blank shot "
as a signal to the Amy to stop. The Detroit answered with 
"a musket, the ball of which struck the Guanabara; then, "
"seizing his speaking trumpet, Captain Bronson - of the "
"Detroit hailed Admiral Da Gama and said, ""I have fired "
"and struck your ship. If you fire again, I will sink you."" "
"Da Gama answered, ""I surrender."" The Amy soon reached "
"the quay, and it was no longer necessary for the president "
of the Brazilian Republic to consider the good offices of 
the American admiral. The insurrection was ended. This 
was the last attempt on the Western Hemisphere to estab 
lish a monarchy. The Brazilians wanted Da Garna turned 
"over to them, but this was not done and he went to Eu "
rope. Although there was not much in the papers about 
"the part Secretary Gresham took in this affair, every South "
American diplomat knew what he did. It was one of the 
things that gave him the confidence of that class. 

"But the Monroe Doctrine, as Secretary Gresham inter "
"preted it, could not be made the cloak for oppression by any "
American nation or the pretext to escape its international 
obligations. 

"Kenesaw Mountain Landis, named after the mountain "
"before which his father was wounded during the Civil War, "
explains why Da Gama was so ready to surrender to Cap 
tain Bronson. When it became apparent that the effort to 



"BRAZIL, NICARAGUA, AND CUBA 781 "

"restore the monarchy would fail, Mendonca, the Brazilian "
"minister, informed Secretary Gresham that the Brazilian "
government had reason to believe it was arranged that the 
British fleet should give asylum to the revolutionary com 
"mander, Admiral Da Gama. Thereupon Secretary Gres "
ham had an interview with Sir Julian Pauncefote and it 
was agreed that that should not be done. Shortly there 
"after, a cablegram reached Secretary Gresham at midnight "
"from Brazil, informing him that the British flagship had "
taken the revolutionary commander Da Gama aboard un 
"der cover of darkness. Get a carriage, Landis. We must "
"go and see Sir Julian."" At two o clock in the morn "
"ing, the darkness of the British Embassy was broken by "
"lights from cellar to garret, as excited lackeys and secre "
taries hastily gathered in answer to the summons of their 
chief. Greeting the Secretary of State Sir Julian desired 
"to know, ""To what am I indebted for the favor of this "
"call? "" Secretary Gresham replied, ""Sir Julian, I have word "
from Brazil that your flagship has taken Da Gama aboard. 
"Of course that is not true. You and I know it is not true, "
but I must be able to tell the President and Cabinet when 
"we meet this morning that it is not true. Good morning, "
"Sir Julian."" Before the Cabinet met at n o clock that "
"morning, Sir Julian had called at the State Department and "
informed the Secretary of State that he had cabled the 
"British Foreign Office, which, through the British Admir "
"alty, had communicated with the flagship in the harbor of "
"Rio, and Da Gama had been put back on his own ship. "

"For almost fifty years, notwithstanding the Clayton- "
"Bulwer treaty, which provided for the neutralization of a "
canal at or near the Isthmus and the independence of Cen 
"tral America, Great Britain had claimed sovereignty in the "
Bluefield Reservation of Nicaragua through the Mosquito 
"Indians. By the treaty of Mandgua of January 28, 1860, "
"between Great Britain and Nicaragua, Great Britain had "
asserted the independence of the Indians and her right to 



782 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN ORE SHAM 

"protect them. In construing this treaty of Mandgua, the "
"Emperor of Austria, July i, 1889, as an arbitrator, upheld "
"the pretensions of Great Britain, and, among other things, "
"held that Nicaragua should pay the Mosquito chief $5,000 "
per annum for a term of years. The United States was not 
"a party to this arbitration, and was not even consulted in "
advance as to its terms and the questions the arbitrator 
would pass on. Nicaragua refused to abide by the award 
and appealed to the United States. 

With all Air. Elaine s bluster he accomplished no re 
sults. Thomas F. Bayard was familiar with every phase 
of the subject. Secretary of State Gresham had had a touch 
of it in President Arthur s administration. Mr. Bayard 
"pressed the English government direct, while Mr. Gresham "
negotiated with Sir Julian Pauncefote. 

"To Mr. Bayard the Secretary of State wrote June 7, "
"1894, as follows: "

I have read many times your admirable instructions of Novem 
"ber 23, 1888, to Mr. Phelps, American minister to London, and "
have said to the President that I think this administration should 
stand by it. You very correctly stated in your instructions to 
Mr. Phelps that when the Indians accepted the provisions made 
"for them in the treaty of [Mandgua], direct relations were estab "
"lished between them and Nicaragua, and Great Britain ceased to "
be their protector or guardian. 

"To Sir Julian, Secretary Gresham argued, ""There can "
"not be two sovereignties in the same territory."" When Sir "
"Julian said, as both Secretary of State Gresham and Ambas "
"sador Bayard anticipated he would, that under the treaty "
Great Britain was bound to see that Nicaragua did not op 
"press the Mosquito Indians, Secretary Gresham answered, "
"We will see that she does not. Nicaragua, on our demand, "
promptly paid the sum she was in arrears to the Indians 
"under the award of the Austrian Emperor, and Great Brit "
ain withdrew all her pretensions to sovereignty in Nica 
ragua. More was accomplished by the conferences with 



"BRAZIL, NICARAGUA, AND CUBA 783 "

the British ambassador and the Nicaraguan minister than 
by correspondence. 

No sooner had Great Britain withdrawn her claim to 
"sovereignty in Nicaragua than a revolution, in which Am "
"ericans and British subjects were the leaders, broke out "
in the Mosquito strip against the Nicaraguan authority. 
These Americans and British subjects were expelled from 
"the Nicaraguan territory without any form of trial, and "
without giving them time to make necessary preparations 
for such a journey. 

"On remonstrances by our government, the Americans were "
permitted to return and continue unmolested in the exercise 
"of their usual business, but not so with the British subjects. "
Great Britain remonstrated and demanded an indemnity. 

"I shall let Serior Romero, the Mexican minister to the "
"United States, conclude this incident in a paper he pre "
pared for publication a short time after my husband s 
"death, but which was not published, possibly because Mr. "
Romero concluded it contained too many State secrets. 

"One day in April, 1895, when I went to see Mr. Gresham, I "
found him very busy at his office consulting the records of the 
Department about the application of the Monroe Doctrine in the 
Corinto or Nicaragua affair 

"Nicaragua refused to pay the indemnity, and finally Great "
"Britain sent, -on February 26, 1895, an ultimatum through the "
commander of one of her men-of-war to the Nicaraguan govern 
"ment, demanding an apology, an immediate payment of 15,500 "
"pounds sterling as a preliminary indemnity, and a further indem "
nity to be fixed by arbitration excluding all American govern 
"ments, and threatening to take possession of some territory if "
the apology and payments were refused. I was under the impres 
sion that Great Britain had previously informed the United States 
"that they intended to enforce the payment in that way, and not "
"seize Nicaraguan territory for permanent keeping, and that she "
obtained in either a direct or an indirect way the assurance that 
"the United States would not interfere, because otherwise I do not "
think Great Britain would have dared to occupy Corinto. My 
50



784 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

reasons for thinking so were corroborated by what took place about 
"the British Guiana boundary dispute, but I was afterwards assured "
by well-informed sources that there was no previous accord then. 

When Nicaragua received the British ultimatum she applied 
"at once to the United States for protection, because all the Central "
"Republics consider the United States as their natural protector, "
and they think that this government will come to their rescue 
"in their complications with foreign countries, no matter what may "
"be the nature of the same, and in this belief they have been sup "
"ported by the opinion of Mr. James G. Blaine, who, while Secre "
tary of State of the United States during President Garfield s ad 
"ministration, stated that this country is the natural protector "
of all the American republics. 

Mr. Gresham was studying in the records of the Department 
the action of the government in similar questions. When I 
"came into his office, he seemed glad to see me and he asked for "
my opinion on the subject and what the United States had done 
in the case of Mexico when the French Emperor sent an army to 
"interfere in our political affairs, and take possession of the country. "

"When I reminded him that the three allied powers, France, "
"England, and Spain, had signed in London on October 31, 1861. "
"a treaty of alliance to intervene in Mexico, and had asked the "
"United States to join them, and that this country had refused "
"that invitation, recognizing the right of the allies to make war "
"upon Mexico, Mr. Gresham very properly remarked that Mr. "
Seward s answer would very likely have been quite different had 
this country been at that time at peace. He further said that 
the Nicaragua incident was not a case in which the United States 
"could be asked to interfere, as the Monroe Doctrine was not "
"affected by it, since Great Britain did not intend to make any "
"permanent acquisitions of territory, but only tried to enforce a "
claim against another country. 

He thought that Nicaragua being an independent nation 
"Great Britain had a perfect right to enforce that claim upon her, "
"and even seize, for the time being, a portion of her territory in "
case of non-payment. From the records of the Department of 
State it appeared that the United States government acted in a 
similar way toward Paraguay in 1858 under Mr. Buchanan s 
"administration, when, having a claim against that country which "



"BRAZIL, NICARAGUA, AND CUBA 785 "

"Paraguay would not settle, they sent an armed expedition to en "
force it; and Mr. Gresham said that they could not deny to Great 
Britain the exercise of the same right under similar circumstances. 

"In Mr. Gresham s opinion, Nicaragua had done a wrong in "
"expelling from her territory without any trial a British subject, "
and Great Britain had a right to demand satisfaction on that 
"offense, going to the extent of making war; and the United States "
had no right to interfere under the Monroe Doctrine as long as 
Great Britain did not attempt to make a permanent acquisition 
of territory. 

Mr. Gresham very properly said that Nicaragua as an inde 
pendent country must accept the duties and responsibilities of 
"such, and that if by her wrong-doing she offends other powers, "
she cannot ask the United States to take up her quarrels originat 
ing from acts that she had done against the opinion and advice 
of the United States. 

"The United States did not interfere then in that case, and in "
consequence of this the British men-of-war landed some marines 
"at the port of Corinto and took possession of the town on April 2 7 , "
"1895, the Nicaraguan garrison having previously been withdrawn "
to the interior. 

"To me, Mr. Gresham s position in the case was unassailable, "
although that incident after the Hawaiian question was perhaps 
the reason for which he was more or less abused by his political 
opponents. It would have made him very popular if he had 
tried to bully Great Britain by bringing the Monroe Doctrine 
"in the case, but as a fair man and a man of principle he could not "
"do so, and so he preferred to do right rather than to gain popularity "
at the expense of justice. With a view to justifying this construc 
"tion of the Monroe Doctrine, Professor John B. Moore of Columbia "
College published a pamphlet expounding the Monroe Doctrine. 

During the time Secretary Gresham was probing the 
"Venezuelan question to the bottom, the situation in the "
Cuban revolt against Spain had become acute. I am not 
denying that many of our citizens were clandestinely vio 
lating our neutrality laws in aiding the Cuban insurgents. 
Every precaution was taken by the Cleveland administra 
"tion to prevent the shipment of arms and supplies to Cuba, "



786 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

but with our long coast line it was easy for men who had 
been trained by Great Britain in running the blockade of 
"our Southern ports during our Civil War, to get through "
the blockade poor old Spain was endeavoring to maintain 
around the island of Cuba. W. C. Whitney was abroad at 
"this time, and was writing and telegraphing information that "
was useful but did not go into the archives of the State De 
partment. I do not think any one will question the fact 
"that Walter Q. Gresham, long before he entered the State "
"Department, was familiar with every fact and principle "
suggested and advanced for the settlement of the claims 
against Great Britain for the depredations on American 
"commerce by the Confederate cruisers Alabama and Florida, "
"under the Treaty of Washington, ""the most enduring "
"monument to General Grant s fame."" "

Acting on information furnished by Grossman &amp; Bro 
"ther, Secretary of State Gresham, on March 14, 1895, sent "
"to Harris Taylor, the American minister at Madrid, the "
following dispatch: 

"This Department is informed that on the 8th instant, the "
"United States mail steamship Alliance, on her homeward voy "
"age from Colon to New York, when six miles from the coast of "
"Cuba, off Cape Maysi, was repeatedly fired on by a Spanish gun "
"boat with solid shot, which fortunately fell short. The Wind "
"ward Passage, where this occurred, is the natural and usual "
highway for vessels plying between ports of the United States 
and the Caribbean Sea. Through it several regular lines of Am 
erican mail and commercial steamers pass weekly within sight 
of Cape Maysi. They are well known and their voyage embraces 
no Cuban port of call. Forcible interference with them cannot be 
"claimed as a belligerent act, whether they pass within three miles "
"of the Cuban coast or not, and can under no circumstances be tol "
erated when no state of war exists. This government will expect 
prompt disavowal of the unauthorized act and due expression of 
"regret on the part of Spain, and it must insist that immediate "
and positive orders be given to Spanish naval commanders not 
to interfere with legitimate American commerce passing through 



"BRAZIL, NICARAGUA, AND CUBA 787 "

"that channel, and prohibiting all acts wantonly imperiling life "
and property lawfully under the flag of the United States. You 
will communicate this to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and urge 
the importance of a prompt and satisfactory response. 

The publication of this dispatch greatly perturbed Mr. 
"Cleveland, but brought on the next day an answer from "
Mr. Taylor that the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs 
would make a specific and formal reply the moment the facts 
could be obtained from Cuba by telegram; also it brought 
a cablegram of congratulation from William C. Whitney. 

"The newspapers, of course, were full of the incident for "
"the next few days, and there were many communications "
"between Washington and Madrid. April 16, the Secretary "
of State sent this telegram to Mr. Taylor: 

A month having elapsed since you communicated to the Span 
ish government the representations of this government touching 
the firing upon the Alliance on the high sea off Cape Maysi while 
"innocently sailing under the American flag, the President depre "
cates further delay in responding to our just expectations. This 
government has given due weight to the serious situation in Spain 
"and Cuba, but evidence appears so clearly to establish that the "
"act complained of was indefensible, if not wanton, that delay is "
not understood. 

This brought expression of regret and explanations that 
"inasmuch as the Alliance was outside the three-mile limit, "
the officer in charge of the Spanish guard boat had been 
removed to another field and that instructions had been 
given that would prevent a repetition of the incident. 
"After Mr. Gresham s death, Mr. Cleveland replied to the "
"Spanish government that its explanations were satisfactory, "
and the incident was ended. 

Despite the fact that the American government had 
"large interests to conserve in both China and Japan, at the "
outbreak of hostilities between these countries each bellig 
"erent hastened to place its affairs, in the territory of the "
"other, in the hands of the American government. "



788 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"With Mr. Kurino, the Japanese minister, Secretary of "
State Gresham had been especially intimate from the be 
ginning. Mr. Kurino had the distinction of securing for 
his country from the United States the first favored nation 
"al treaty that was accorded it, a treaty which subsequent "
administrations endeavored to modify. Secretary of State 
Gresham had no hesitancy in advising Mr. Cleveland and 
the Senate to accord it to them. With the Chinese min 
"ister, Mr. Yang-Yu, Mr. Gresham was on the best of terms, "
"while Madame Yang-Yu, as I have shown, regarded me as "
one of her special friends. 

Not a great while before the treaty of peace between 
China and Japan I heard my husband tell Senator Platt of 
"Connecticut that he feared Russia, France, England, and "
"Germany, in the event of the Japanese armies crushing "
"China, might, under the guise of preserving order in China, "
partition that country. 

"During the settlement of the Chinese-Japanese War, "
Col. John W. Foster gave out the report that he was cogni 
"zant of the views of, and was acting in harmony with, the "
American government. This brought forth the following 
"inquiry from the Senate, at the instance of Senator Stew "
art of Nevada: 

Resolved: That the Secretary of State be directed to inform 
the Senate whether John W. Foster has any official relations with 
the United States in assisting China in the peace negotiations 
with Japan. 

The following was the answer: 

"The Secretary of State, in response to the resolution of the "
"Senate dated January 4, 1895, has by direction of the President "
"the honor to say that Mr. John W. Foster, in assisting China "
"in peace negotiations with Japan, sustains no official or other "
relations to the United States. 

"Respectfully submitted, "

W. Q. GRESHAM.

"Mr. Kurino, the Japanese minister, told me his version "
"of the sudden ending of the war when, after my husband s "
"death, he and the secretary of the Japanese legation, M. "
"Matsu, brought me as a gift from the Emperor of Japan a "
"beautiful piece of tapestry, eleven feet wide by twenty-five "
"feet long, too large for any ordinary residence, and two "
Cloisonne vases. Mr. Kurino told my son and myself that 
during the Chinese- Japanese War he met Mr. Gresham 
"almost daily, and received from him information as to what "
was going on in the diplomatic world. This information 
"he daily cabled to his government. ""One day"" said Mr. "
"Kurino, ""Secretary Gresham said to me, Japan should "
bring the war to a conclusion. If she continues to knock 
"China to pieces, the powers, England, France, Germany, "
"and Russia, under the guise of preserving order, will par "
tition China. This information and the advice I trans 
mitted immediately by cable to my government. And you 
"know what we did. We ended the war almost as abruptly."" "

TT^VERYTHING was moving along most auspiciously 
-* ^ when in April my husband contracted a cold. In 
May it developed into pleurisy. After three weeks in bed 
"the liquid was almost absorbed, and the physicians said "
"that in a few days he could be out, when, on the 26th of "
"May, pneumonia suddenly developed, and on the 28th of "
"May, 1895, the end came. "

We went to Chicago for the funeral as it seemed to 
"me that this should be the burial place. Mr. Cleveland, "
"the members of the cabinet, the Mexican minister, Mr. "
"Romero, the Brazilian minister, Mr. Mendosa, and many "
others accompanied us. 

"After we reached Chicago, it was decided not to inter "
my husband s body permanently in that city. Although 
"Chicago had been our home, and was, therefore, an appro "
"priate resting place for my husband s remains, it was urged "
on me that his long public service made it fitting that 
his body should lie in the capital. We therefore decided 
"to place it temporarily in a burial vault, and this was done. "

THE END 791 

The funeral ceremonies in Chicago were elaborate and 
impressive. The soldier element was naturally prominent. 
I saw that Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Olney took particular 
"notice of this, for neither of them went to the front in 61, "
and I was interested in the effect on them of the many 
"evidences of my husband s hold on his old army comrades, "
both rank and file. All along our route to Chicago the 
"G. A. R. men had turned out strong. At Chicago, the entire "
Illinois Commandery of the military order of the Loyal 
"Legion, over six hundred, met us. Never before nor since "
has the Illinois Commandery of the Loyal Legion as a 
body publicly appeared to pay its tribute to any man. 
"Men who in 1888 had sung, Good-bye, Old Grover, Good "
"bye,"" men who had deprecated my husband s entering the "
"cabinet of a man who had employed a substitute in the war, "
turned out to show their loyalty to a government whose 
integrity they had saved and to whose perpetuity they were 
"pledged. There were men like General A. C. McClurg, "
"General McArthur, General Fitzsimmons, General Mc- "
"Nulta, and General Walter Newberry; Major Blodgett, "
"the brother of Judge Blodgett; Captain Stewart, post- "
"office inspector of Whisky Trust fame; Colonel Pearson, "
who commanded the regiment in which he had enlisted as 
"a boy, ""Logan s old regiment""; lawyers by the score, like "
Colonel Huntington W. Jackson and Colonel James S. 
"Cooper; judges, like Tuthill, Freeman, and Waterman "
men before whom even the invisible government failed. 
Their message of condolence had been acknowledged before 
"we left Washington, as the most appreciated of all. "

It took me a year to make up my mind as to Mr. Gres- 
ham s final resting place. Inasmuch as my husband had 
"given so much of his life to the preservation of the nation, "
it seemed to me that he ought to be buried in a National 
Cemetery. Many times we had ridden together through 
"Arlington Cemetery. I decided on Arlington, and accord "
ingly wrote President Cleveland that I thought Arlington 



792 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"was the place, and that a certain lot near the Lee mansion, "
"looking out over the Potomac and the city of Washington, "
was the desired spot. Promptly Mr. Cleveland and Secre 
tary of War Lamont answered that the lot was at my dis 
"posal. In May, 1896, I started for Washington with Mr. "
"Gresham s body, and May 15 reached the city and went "
"directly to Arlington, where we were met by President "
"Cleveland and the cabinet, and the final interment was "
made. 

"After the ceremony at the cemetery, I went to the "
"Arlington Hotel, and soon Mr. Thurber, the President s "
"secretary, and Sir Julian Pauncefote, the British Ambassa "
"dor, and the members of the cabinet called, to pay their "
respects. The next day the President sent a carriage for 
"us to come to Woodley, the Cleveland country place. "

Two national conventions were then close at hand. 
"The question was, Would the silver men dominate not only "
"one but both? About thirty days before, Secretary of the "
Treasury Carlisle had been in Chicago and had made a 
sound money speech in which he controverted the coinage 
of silver at sixteen to one. Mrs. Carlisle told me that Mr. 
Cleveland would soon announce that he would be bound 
by the third term tradition and that Mr. Carlisle would be 
the candidate of the sound money men for president. The 
sound money men had not centered and did not center on 
"Mr. Carlisle, and Mr. Cleveland made no announcement, "
but at that Woodley visit Mr. Cleveland expressed without 
reserve the apprehension he felt as to what would be the 
effect on the country if the silver men succeeded. I could 
not but recall the warning my husband had given him two 
years before. He was no longer assuming to dictate. He 
expressed his pleasure and astonishment when my son told 
"him that ""Tom"" Taggart, John E. Lamb, Senator Voorhees "
"law partner, John W. Kern, A. G. Smith, and scores of "
others in Indiana and Illinois were sound money men and 
could be counted on to do almost anything he desired. 



THE END 793 

Cleveland then launched into an exposition of the financial 
"relation of the coinage of silver, at sixteen to one, to gold, "
the actual value at that time being about thirty-three to 
"one, that was illuminating and convincing, but his audience "
"was limited. Men like Senator Voorhees, who was still "
"the chairman of the Finance Committee of the Senate, the "
"men from the South and West, would not go near him. 1 "

I am not saying that Mr. Cleveland contemplated a 
"third term, but I do say he understood the act of handling "
men and public questions. He could not be ignorant of 
the possibility of the use of his name as a candidate as a 
"rallying standard for the sound money men, especially "
"when suggested by ""practical men."" Notwithstanding "
the public rancor between Grover Cleveland on one side 
"and Tammany and Senator Hill on the other, there always "
existed a certain connection between them. Daniel S. 
Lamont was this connecting link. At the time of which I 
write the three were in perfect unison. And Grover Cleve 
"land was saying, as he said on that occasion, ""Tell the "
boys they can not win with sixteen to one. The laboring 
"men and the business men will be against them."" "

The last time I saw. Mr. Cleveland he came to Chicago 
to deliver an address before the Union League Club on the 
"22d of February, 1906. He came to see me and I sat with "
him at a dinner. He was in declining health. He was 
"still strong and cheerful, but he knew, and he knew that I "
"knew, although neither of us said so, that his end was not "
"far off. My own years were numbered, a fact to which I "
referred. Again he was most unreserved in his talk. One 
"woman, after the dinner was over, asked me what Mr. "
"Cleveland talked about. While no secrecy was enjoined, "
"it was implied, so I did not enlighten her. "

There was another public question in which Secretary 
of State Gresham participated that lived after him. That 
was the Venezuelan matter. That sense of justice and 

"1 See Chapter XLV, especially pages 705 and 708. "



794 LIFE OF W ALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"fairness in Sir Julian Pauncefote, and the discernment of "
"how to reach it, which was the real reason for the settlement "
"of the Nicaraguan question, led Mr. Gresham to believe he "
could adjust the Venezuelan controversy without friction. 
"This was also Ambassador Bayard s view, for in this con "
nection and at this time he wrote privately to the Secretary 
"of State: ""Great Britain has just now her hands very full "
in other quarters of the globe. The United States is the 
last nation on earth with whom the British people or their 
"rulers desire to quarrel, and of this I have new proofs every "
day in my intercourse with them. The other European 
"nations are watching each other like pugilists in the ring."" "
"Of Sir Julian Pauncefote, Secretary Gresham wrote to Mr. "
"Bayard: ""While he is a firm supporter of British interests, "
"he is candid and fights openly and is fair."" "

"After all, it was only a question of boundary. England "
"had been in South America, in English Guiana, for a hun "
"dred years, and is there yet. The dispute as to the bound "
"ary, , between England and Venezuela, arose in 1887 while "
Thomas F. Bayard was Secretary of State. It again be 
came acute in 1894. Realizing the hopelessness of contend 
"ing with Great Britain in arms, the Venezuelan government "
and the speculators rushed off to the United States. 

"It is of record that on December i, 1894, Secretary of "
"State Gresham wrote to Ambassador Bayard, instructing "
him to state to the English government that 

England and America are fully committed to the principle of 
"arbitration, 1 and this government will gladly do what it can to "
further a determination in that sense. 

"With a view to a peaceful settlement, Mr. Gresham was "
"working, up to the time of his death, on ""a statement of "
"the case."" He said he believed he could make a statement "

"Speech dedicating the Grant monument. ""It was the successful leader of our armies "
in our greatest war who took the lead in bringing the civilized world to a practical recognition 
"of the value of a peaceful arbitrament of international disputes, and the Treaty of Washington "
is a monument to his memory which will outlive those of bronze and stone. Its moral influence 
"extends infinitely beyond the immediate parties to it, or the age in which it was negotiated."" "

of the facts and the controversy and advance conclusions 
"that the British government could accept, or come back "
"and say, ""You have suggested it we will arbitrate."" "
"Night after night he poured over maps, papers, and differ "
"ent propositions, and all the data extant on the Monroe "
doctrine. The final rough draft was recast and rewritten 
"a number of times. The legal and judicial training,"" the "
"British Ambassador said, ""which enabled the Secretary of "
State to go to the bottom of a question and look through 
"a treaty with facility and ease, were brought into play."" "
He discussed the question not only with President Cleve 
land but with members of the Senate and House and with 
"newspaper men. (""There was always at least one news "
"paper man,"" he said, ""you could get to stand for right and "
"justice and who was withal discreet."") Isaclore Strauss "
was one of the congressmen whose counsel and advice was 
sought. Afterwards one of the editors of the New York 
"Evening Post, in writing of these days, said: "

Secretary Gresham was very diligent in circulating from the 
State Department copies of the Monroe Doctrine as enunciated 
by Monroe in defense of his abstention from meddling as the 
jingoes wished him to do in the Nicaragua affair. Thousands 
of copies of a pamphlet of its own and thousands of copies 
also of the Evening Post reprint of Professor Moore s essay on 
"the Doctrine, were sent out by the Department. "

My husband was shaping his note for transmission to 
Ambassador Bayard when sickness and death intervened. 
"Richard Olney, the Attorney-General, became Secretary of "
"State. July 17, 1895, Mr. Olney sent his note, which was "
"practically an ultimatum, through Ambassador Bayard, "
to Great Britain. Its statement followed the line of fact 
my husband had outlined so closely that Isadore Straus 
"said, ""Mr. Olney has stolen your husband s thunder,"" "
"No, said I, ""there was to be no ultimatum as my hus "
"band had prepared it, and Mr. Olney and President Cleve "
"land are entitled to all the credit for such a State paper."" "



796 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

"Mr. Bayard assumed the responsibility to state, when he "
"delivered Mr. Olney s note to the British Foreign Office, that "
"it did not really mean what it said War. Not, however, "
until Mr. Cleveland followed the note up with a message 
"to Congress on the 4th of December, 1895, did the corre "
spondence become public. Mr. Cleveland s message was 
a reiteration of the ultimatum. It electrified the country. 
The jingoists and the newspapers went wild. The Repub 
licans almost universally said they were Cleveland men. 
Ex-President Harrison said he would step into line with 
"the brother from Georgia under the order, ""Guide center "
"forward,"" against ""my ancient enemy."" Senator Henry "
"Cabot Lodge, who happened to be temporarily sojourn "
"ing in London, kept the cables hot with demands for im "
mediate war. 

But all was changed in the twinkling of an eye. The 
New York Evening Post and The Nation stood by their 
guns. Heretofore they had been Cleveland s strongest and 
ablest supporters. Now they denounced the note and the 
message as a departure from the Monroe Doctrine as its 
author had promulgated it and as it had been interpreted 
by Secretary Gresham. The message was a bid for a third 
"term, and Secretary Olney had gone over to the specula "
"tors. 1 Soon, to use the Evening Post s own language, ""Sec "
"retary Olney turned tail."" There was an arbitration, but "
the Venezuelans were defeated. 

I have written this not by way of criticism of Mr. Cleve 
"land but to make clear Walter Q. Gresham s position, and "
to emphasize the power a single private citizen or a single 
editor may exert in the Republic. It is also due to Mr. 

"1 January 9, 1896, The Nation said: ""The speculators, as we see, expected a more vigor "
"ous foreign policy about this time. We have reason to believe that some of them, including "
"United States senators who are to sit on these questions of peace or war, waited on Secretary "
Gresham not long before his death to urge this policy on him; but being a clear-headed man of 
"peace, he not only declined their proposals, but took the liberty of pointing out to them the "
impropriety of their having anything to do with an affair which was likely to become a matter 
of international controversy. We are far from insinuating that they ever made any similar 
"application to Mr. Olney, but he certainly did just what they wanted. The jingo poison "
"prepares a man s system for the speculation bacillus."" "



THE END 797 

"Cleveland to say, that after it was all over he claimed it "
was the threat of war that made Great Britain accept 
"arbitration, but the fact is, she did not suggest it. Pressed "
"to the wall, Mr. Olney said, ""Mr. Gresham has suggested "
"arbitration, whereupon Great Britain acquiesced."" "

"In his recollections of Grover Cleveland, George F. "
"Parker says, in discussing the Venezuelan incident: "

It always seemed to strike him with surprise when in later 
"years I told him apparently in jest, though really in earnest "
that he was the father of the spirit of imperialism which had 
grown up after the war with Spain. He himself had done so 
"much to controvert that foolish, unnecessary, and hurtful con "
"flict, that he could scarcely conceive that what he saw was only "
the logic of his own acts. 

"Here the practical side again suggests itself, for Grover "
Cleveland was an eminently practical man. Mr. Cleveland 
was then contesting with William Jennings Bryan for su 
premacy in the Democratic party. An ultimatum to Great 
"Britain, or a twist of the lion s tail, and his party might "
abandon silver at sixteen to one. That soldier funeral came 
just at the time to impress Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Olney. 

By no act or word of his did Walter Q. Gresham ad 
vance the policy of imperialism which he believed would be 
"our undoing, just as it had wrecked the Roman republic. "
Despotisms can and do exist under popular forms. Talk 
about the United States becoming a world power! She 
"had been one ever since July 4, 1776. The Declaration of "
Independence and the success of the American Republic 
were the great contributing causes of the French Revolu 
"tion, which with all its blood and counter-revolution made "
much for the rights of man the world over. 

"To a critic who wanted ""a great foreign policy,"" Mr. "
Gresham answ r ered: 

A free government cannot pursue an imperial policy. We 
acquire territory with the sole expectation of bringing it into the 
"Union as a State, the equal of the other States. "



798 LIFE OF WALTER QUINTIN GRESHAM 

Secretary of State Gresham s chief work in connection 
with Germany was to advise 1 and urge upon President 
Cleveland \hat he recommend to Congress the withdrawal 
"from the Tri-Parte Treaty of 1889, whereby the United "
"States, Great Britain, and Germany, because of trade re "
"lations, had agreed jointly to maintain Malietoa as King "
of the Samoan Islands. The death of King Malietoa in 
1898 ended an anomalous situation. 

To another friendly critic he wrote : 

"If we take Hawaii, we must defend it just as we should our "
own Atlantic and Pacific ports. But aside from this we need 
more and better ships. 

To another : 

The Democrats in the Senate and the House are furnished 
with ample material but they lack the ability or the courage to 
use it. 

I would that Thomas F. Bayard were in the Senate. Senator 
Gray possessed the ability but he shrinks the contest. 

"To his associates in the administration, according to the "
"Secretary of the Treasury, John G. Carlisle, Secretary of "
"State Gresham said, in speaking of the Venezuelan incident, "
"I have come over to you; gentlemen, come up to the best "
"traditions of the Republic."" 2 The Secretary of State was "
then deprecating war. Because we w T on our independence 

"1 May 9, 1894, on a report on the Samoan situation Secretary of State Gresham said to "
President Cleveland: 

It is in our relations with Samoa that we have made the first departure from our tra 
ditional and well established policy of avoiding entangling alliances with foreign powers in 
"relation to objects remote from this hemisphere. . . Every nation, and especially "

"every strong nation, must sometime be conscious of an impulse to rush into difficulties that "
do not concern it except in a highly imaginary way. To restrain the indulgence of such a 
"propensity is not only the part of wisdom, but a duty we owe to the world as an example "
"of the strength, the moderation, and the beneficence of popular government."" "

"2 MY DEAR MR. Ross: November 9, 1894. "
The leading editorial in the Indianapolis News of the ;th is the best that I have seen on 

the result of the late elections. I wish every so-called Democratic leader could read it. I 
will hand it to the President to-morro\v. 

The people seem to have thought it necessary to strike the Democratic Party with clubs 
not stuffed. Will it recover from the blows? 

I imagine you will say it may if it becomes more honest. 

"Faithfully yours, W. Q. GRESHAM. "

with the sword did not seem to him any reason why we 
should rush into war on the slightest provocation. He 
certainly had seen enough of the desolation and ruin wrought 
in our own land to want no more of it. It was a subject 
"I felt competent to discuss with any man, especially with "
the men who had had an opportunity for four years to go 
"in but did not do so. As General Sherman truly said, ""War "
"is hell."" In its ultimate analysis it is a crime against "
civilization and against the rights and interests of the indi 
vidual man and woman. 1 To that view r Walter Q. Gresham 
"had come. We had jingoists then, but then, as now, not "
all jingoists were fighters. 

While my husband had become an advocate of peace 
he was not a non-resistant. He would and could fight. 
He had that knowledge of mechanics and machinery which 
is essential to the successful prosecution of a modern war. 
Never would Walter Q. Gresham have attempted to meet 
a submarine simply with a State paper. And that disre 
gard which General Grant had taught him for the elemen 
tary maxims of war when they were plainly an outgrowth 
"of conditions radically different from those to be confronted, "
"w^as proof conclusive that he would ""flex"" the rules of war "
"as he had ""flexed"" the rules of equity. He had reckoned "
"the power of a single man, of a few men, using modern "
explosives. 2 

I remember the interest my husband took in the Chicago 
"Haymarket riot. A rich Italian, Count Malatesto, with "
"headquarters in London, was the head of the anarchists, "
who had proclaimed their purpose of killing off all govern 
mental officers and of taking possession of government and 
"industry. The night of May 4, 1886, a single bomb killed "
eight policemen outright and wounded and disabled sixty- 
"eight, practically annihilating the first platoon. And the "
"truth is, the oncoming platoons of police all but broke "

although supported by three regiments of the Illinois Na 
"tional Guard, a battalion of colored troops, and a battery, "
all under command of General Charles Fitzsimmons. 1 
"Fitz had passed the word to his colonels, they in turn to "
the captains and they to the men. Every man responded 
to the call. There is not a word in the record about these 
troops. But for every possible contingency they were pre 
pared. There were officers and men in the streets ready 
to attack any force that might offer resistance to the regi 
ments as they came out of the narrow doors of their armo 
ries in columns of fours. They even had men at Haymarket 
Square. The police had to advance or be disgraced. 
After the Supreme Court of Illinois sustained the death 
penalty against eight of the men convicted of the murder 
"of policeman Mathias Began, Governor Oglesby commuted "
"the sentence of two of them, Fielden and Schwab, to impris "
"onment for life. General Benjamin F. Butler then claimed, "
in a habeas corpus proceeding before United States Circuit 
"Judge Gresham, that Fielden and Schwab were restrained "
of their liberty by the State of Illinois contrary to the due 
process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the 
"Constitution. ""All Fielden and Schwab did,"" said General "
"Butler, ""was to indulge in the constitutional right of free "
"speech."" ""But, General, they w r ere something more than "
"mere gabblers,"" said the Judge, and so they were remanded "
to the custody of the State. 

"One of the stories, I remember, at a dinner at which "
"Carter H. Harrison, the elder, was a guest, was of his trip "
"around the world. At Berlin, Prince Bismarck sent for Mr. "
"Harrison for the purpose, as Bismarck said, of learning of "
"the Chicago Haymarket riot, from the man who had been "
mayor of the city at the time. Bismarck said that it had 
been a problem with him whether any organized body of 

"1 General Fitzsimmons, and Lieutenant Colonel George V. Lauman and Colonel Taylor "
"E. Brown, a lieutenant and a captain respectively in the First Illinois, I. N. G., at the time, "
"the latter two still living, are among our authorities for these statements. "

"men, police or soldiers, would stand in the streets against "
an attack of a few men armed with dynamite in the shape 
of bombs. Had the Chicago policemen given way at Hay- 
market Square when the first platoon was annihilated by a 
"bomb, it might have been the end of civil government as we "
understand it. The fact that the oncoming platoons were 
"able to disperse the mob, solved the problem, concluded "
Prince Bismarck. 

As illustrating the difference between the judicial and 
"the pardoning power, which is in the executive, Walter Q. "
Gresham was one of the men who had requested Governor 
Oglesby to commute the anarchists sentences. 1 

"In the ultimate analysis, according to Judge Gresham, "
"society and government still rest on force. ""The considera "
tion that international law is without a court for its enforce 
"ment, and that obedience to its commands practically "
depends upon good faith instead of the mandate of a 
"superior tribunal,"" was one of its defects. The chancellor "
"or judge without a sheriff, a policeman, or a soldier, to "
"enforce his lofty utterance, would be an object of ridicule "
and scorn. 

"Before he entered the State Department, Walter Q. "
"Gresham had contemplated the airship as an engine of war, "
"the Gatlin, the Maxim, or the machine gun, gun cotton, "
dynamite and every form of destruction. He talked about 
these means of warfare with regular army men like Gen 
eral Schofield while stationed in Chicago and when in com 
mand of the army at Washington; with Colonel H. C. 
"Corbin, afterwards General Corbin of Spanish-American "
"war fame; with Captain A. M. Fuller, and with many other "
army officers and Union and Confederate veterans. He 
"would get his army from the mechanics, the artisans, the "
farmers who had become mechanics through the use of 
labor-saving machinery ; and the fact that machinery would

make each succeeding war more and more deadly was to 
him a reason why truth and candor should take the place 
of finesse and diplomacy. 

"I heard discussions with men like General Dodge, who "
"was close to Jay Gould, and General John McNulta, and "
others who had served with distinction during the Civil 
"War, who were insistent on the necessity of being pre "
"pared to meet ""Great Britain s descent on the New York "
"and New England coasts,"" and of the consequent import "
"ance of our ""taking Canada."" General Dodge was a corps "
"commander of the Civil War. 1 An able civil engineer, the "
"builder of the Union Pacific Railroad, he never was on the "
side of the people. Judge Gresham argued: 

We would soon starve Great Britain into submission. 
Our first act would be to cut off her supply of grain 
"and beef. Then, by confiscating the billions of English "
"capital invested in this country, we could do her still more "
"damage, and more than recoup the cost of the war on our "
part. We don t want Canada. We could take it in thirty 
days. Every Irishman in the United States and almost all 
in Canada would instantly respond to a call to arms. In 
"Illinois alone, outside of the foreign element, I could or "
"ganize 100,000 men in a week s time. But because of all "
the injury we could inflict on the British Empire and her 
people is a conclusive reason why we should not provoke 
"her to a contest, and by no act of mine will it be precip "

"American and English people. It would be a crime."" "

From the start the British Ambassador and Secretary 
of State Gresham had been in accord. Sir Julian Paunce- 
fote was on the mastiff order and a true Democrat at heart. 
I heard many discussions between them. It was agreed 
that the greatest question of the age was the economic 
"or industrial, that of capital and labor. As bearing on "
this problem the British ambassador was greatly interested

"in the possible effect of the labor-saving device, as it had "
come to the Secretary of State in the patent litigation. I 
quote from a letter written by Circuit Judge Gresham on 
"August i, 1892, to Morris Ross of Indianapolis: "

The labor question has come to stay; it cannot be ignored. 
"We are living under new conditions, conditions utterly unlike any "
thing in the past. Labor-saving machinery has given capital an 
advantage that it never possessed before. What is an equitable 
"division of the joint product of capital and labor, and who is to "
decide the question? I fear that the settlement of the contro 
versy will be attended with serious consequences. The laboring 
"men of this country have intelligence and courage, and they firm "
ly believe that they are oppressed. They are growing stronger 
"daily, and unless capital yields, we will have collisions more "
serious than the one which occurred at Homestead. The right 
to acquire and hold property must be recognized. No civiliza 
tion of the past has amounted to anything that did not recognize 
that right. But those who employ labor seem to think that 
"only property rights need protection, and that laborers are en "
titled to no more sympathy and consideration than the machin 
ery which they attend. Employers go through their forms of 
"worship in a perfunctory way, not heeding the injunction that "
we should love our neighbors as ourselves. It seems to me that 
"labor will triumph in the near future, but will it use its power "
wisely ? 

Mr. Gresham said to the British Ambassador that the 
"labor-saving machine had satisfied him as a patent judge, "
"that the productive power of the world would be increased, "
had increased beyond the capacity of the world to con 
"sume. What would be done with the surplus, and how to "
"keep the people of the various countries employed, pros "
"perous, and happy at home, were the great questions to "
"be met. Tariff, laws would protect the home market, but "
home production exceeded the home consumption. How 
"was the surplus to be disposed of, with at least a dozen "
strong nations with a large surplus competing for the single 
world market? This world-wide problem was to be solved

"on principles of righteousness and justice, and the same "
was every day becoming true of the domestic problems. 

"Charles Schwab, as the head of the steel trust, follow "
ing the Spanish-American War justified selling steel products 
in Germany cheaper than in the home market. The cre 
ation of a surplus over and above what the United States 
consumed was the result of keeping the mills running in 
order that men might be employed all the time in this 
country. Germany was not long in retaliating with tariff 
"wall"" laws that permitted her merchants and manufacturers "
to combine in order to sell her surplus in South America 
and on longer time than Englishmen and Americans could or 
would extend to the purchasers. I am no more justifying 
Germany than the former head of the steel trust. Under the 
guise of keeping the mills running was he not really thinking 
more of his output and machines than of the men ? I am not 
advocating a higher wage scale than the men in the steel 
mill received in the days following the organization of the 
steel trust. I am not suggesting that the man who works 
"as a mechanic with his hands, although his intelligence may "
"be superior to that of the financial man, is simply to be "
"considered as a strata in our system of society, which, as "
"my husband said, ""is based on property interests."" The "
"latter are to have a voice in our government, as they have "
"among the dynasties of the old world, but I am suggesting, "
"as Walter Q. Gresham said, ""that the way to finally dispose "
of the surplus production of the civilized nations of the 
"world is not through war."" "

Caught up on courts martial one of the most im 
"portant factors 1 of the war ""wherever I go,"" indicates "
that there was not that entire absence from the technical 
ities of the law that some of Mr. Gresham s kindly critics 
"said his four years service in the field entailed, while, on "
"the other hand, it suggests the judicial quality. But as "
to whether the judicial quality really existed will be rested

"wide experience, who, as the author of many standard legal "
"textbooks ""High on Injunctions,"" ""High on Receivers,"" "
High on Extraordinary Remedies -reviewed the work 
of more judges than any man of his time. At the memorial 
"services of the Chicago Bar Association, June 11, 1895, "
"Mr. High said: ""If I were asked to name the most marked "
and distinguished feature of Walter 0. Gresham s judicial 
"service, the answer would be, that instinctive sense of jus "
tice which he brought to the determination of every case. 
"With him the sense of justice was an instinct, not an acquire "
"ment."" The proposition that justice was the end and "
"aim of government, Mr. Gresham carried into the State "
Department and into our international relations so far as 
lay in his power. 1 

"That Walter Q. Gresham was no diplomat, only a judge, "
but possessing withal enough popularity and force of char 
"acter to render his conclusions or judgments potential, was a "
criticism he enjoyed. That truthfulness which we have shown 
"to have been one of his early characteristics, he carried with "
him into his judicial life and into the State Department. 

From his own statement John W. Foster had some 
difficulty in qualifying as a jurist.- He does not mention 
"that he was postmaster at Evansville, Indiana, for six years "
after the war. Experience as chairman of the Indiana Re 
"publican State Central Committee in the early ;os, under "
"the tutelage of Senator Oliver P. Morton, undoubtedly "
tended to qualify him for the school of diplomacy. But 
experience in that line was not and is not recognized as a 
qualification for admission to practice before the Supreme 
Court of the United States. Its rules require as a con 
dition precedent to admission and practice before it that

a court of last resort of some State or before the Supreme 
Court of the District of Columbia. That the applicant is 
qualified may be shown by certificate or by the oral state 
ment in open court of an attorney well known to the justices 
of the Supreme Court. When Mr. Foster left the diplo 
matic service in 1881 and settled down in Washington to 
"practice international law, he was confronted with this rule "
of the Supreme Court. He had never been admitted to 
practice before the Supreme Court of Indiana. 

"November 15, 1881, is the date of the admission of "
John W. Foster to practice before the Supreme Court of 
Indiana. The order of that court recites that Mr. Foster 
"was present before it. The fact is, he was then in Wash "
"ington. Not three years, but only thirteen days later, "
"namely, November 28, 1881, he was admitted to practice "
before the Supreme Court of the United States. The 
record of that court is that he was admitted as of the Dis 
trict of Columbia on motion of Solicitor-General Phillips. 
The records of the Supreme Court of the District of Col 
umbia show that John W. Foster never was admitted to 
"practice before that court, so that in order to get admitted "
to practice before the Supreme Court of the United States 
a diplomatic statement was made either by or for him. 
We had been on terms of friendship and intimacy with Col

"but ""that indefinable feeling"" arose long before 1895. Dip "
"lomat that he was, John W. Foster in 1888 decried Walter "
Q. Gresham for taking to the path on which he was headed. 

In response to my request Colonel Foster does not 
"produce the letter in which, as he states in his Memoirs,"" "
Judge Gresham manifested a warm desire to have a con 
"ference with him, Colonel Foster, after the announcement "
was made that Judge Gresham was to be Secretary of State. 
"After he retired from public office and active business, "
Colonel Foster says his papers and letters were destroyed.

"WASHINGTON, February 16, 1893 "
MY DEAR JUDGE: 

I have refrained from writing you till the report that you are 
"to be my successor should be, as it now seems to be, sufficiently "
confirmed. I now desire to assure you that no other appoint 
"ment could have been so gratifying to me personally, and I can "
heartily congratulate Mr. Cleveland upon the selection. 

I am very sorry that I shall not be able to be there and induct 
"you into office, as I expect to sail on the 25th instant for Paris "
"to attend the Tribunal of Arbitration. 1 I hope, however, I may "
"be of some service to you before I go, and shall hold myself ready "
"to do anything I can. I shall be in New York on Friday, the 24th. "
Why cannot you happen there on that day? 

I would not presume to say or write anything about political 
"or diplomatic subjects, but possibly my experiences in the organi "
"zation, personnel, and management of the department might be "
"of some use to you. I have ""views"" on those matters which dur "
ing my temporary incumbency I have not thought best to put 
into practice to any great extent. 

"But if I do not see you before I sail, I send you now my most "
"hearty good wishes for great success in this your new post of duty, "
and assure you that if in any way or at any time I can do anything 
"to promote your success, it will be a great pleasure for me to do so. "

I expect to leave here to-morrow to spend Sunday with the 
"children in Watertown, but shall be in Washington on Monday. "

"With congratulations and best wishes to Mrs. Gresham, I "
"am, very truly, "

"they did, meet President-elect Cleveland at Lake wood, N. J., "
"February 22, 1893. My recollection is that a telegram an "
swered Secretary of State Foster and arranged the meet 
"ing at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, New York, February 24, "
1893. Enough has been said of that Lakewood conference 
to show that the three men attending it had an understand 
ing as to what would be the policy of the new administra 
"tion, also how much of the conclusions of that conference "
were communicated to Mr. Foster. 

I have made more mention here of Colonel Foster than 
"of any other of my husband s critics, for he put him in an "
enduring record. 

"The two senators from Massachusetts, George Frisbee "
"Hoar and Henry Cabot Lodge, were Mr. Gresham s chief "
opponents in the Hawaiian affair. They had looked on 
him with favor when he had been a Republican. They 
"led New England. And coming, as they did, from the "
"cradle of popular government, my husband thought their "
"opposition was most unfair, as it was virulent. Much "
"that Senator Lodge said, he obliterated from the record, "
and Senator Hoar s most enduring work is in the efforts 
he made in resisting the policy of imperialism that he stood 
for in Hawaii but opposed in the Philippines. 

The sending of James H. Blount as a commissioner 
to Hawaii to investigate and report to the President his 
"findings and conclusions, without the advice and consent "
"of the Senate, meanwhile paying him out of the contingent "
"fund of the State Department, was resisted and criticized "
in the Senate by Senators Hoar and Lodge as being in the 
"teeth of the Constitution. Twenty years later, on the floor "
"of the United States Senate, Senator Lodge said it was "
President Wilson s right to send special commissioners or 
agents to Mexico. 

While the question of Woman s Suffrage did not become 
"acute in my husband s lifetime, he was disposed, as a matter "
"of justice, to give women the ballot, although he was not "

altogether satisfied with the wisdom of such a departure. 
Unlimited negro suffrage had been a mistake for the mass 
of the negroes as well as to the body politic. My opinion 
is that it will be a mistake for the mass of the women. 

For the rights and integrity of the little nations Walter 
Q. Gresham was one of the first to stand. The Nicaraguan 
"minister said to me, ""I am now received with the same "
consideration at the State Department as is the British 
"minister."" "

It was the judicial training that would have restored the 
Hawaiian Queen. While Mr. Gresham recognized the prac 
"tical side of a law suit, the principal for the guidance of the "
judge which he had learned as a boy from Lord Mansfield s 
"decision in the Sommerset case, 1 he would have followed in "
"Liliuokalani s case. ""Do justice though the heavens fall."" "
Thus Lord Mansfield answered the argument of the lawyer 
"of expediency, in simply liberating a half -civilized African. "

"What Lord Mansfield had in mind, according to my "
"husband s interpretation of that decision, was that the way "
"to keep the heavens, if not the State, from falling, was to "
do justice in the particular case because the precedent for 
good or evil might be of lasting importance to the race. 
Doing justice in Hawaii would have prevented the United 
States from adopting the colonial system. But having 
"adopted the colonial system, Walter Q. Gresham could and "
would have defended it until the people would go back to 
the government of the fathers. I have lived long enough 
to see Benjamin Harrison oppose the policy of imperialism 
"he inaugurated, or permitted to be inaugurated, in Hawaii; "
to see the tariff reduced; and to see the Republican party 
hopelessly split asunder. Due in part to the efforts of 
"Benjamin Harrison, and of his appointee to the Supreme "
"Bench, David J. Brewer, our imperial policy is only pro "
"visional. ""It was the support General Harrison, and Jus "
"tices Brewer and Harlan, gave to Republican Senator W. E, "

"Paris treaty, whereby we acquired the Philippines, through "
"the influence of William Jennings Bryan, was defeated. "
There were Democratic senators who were for uncondi 
tional ratification. Had the Democratic senators remained 
united the Paris treaty would have been rejected. The 
"Platt amendment, which kept our faith with Cuba and "
"without which the Paris treaty could not have been ratified, "
is a fact in the light of which that treaty is to be read. 
Even now the Republicans will not say that they will never 
give up the Philippines. As Walter Q. Gresham concluded 
"the letter of October 18, 1894, on the Hawaiian situation, "
Can the United States consistently insist that other na 
"tions shall respect the independence of Hawaii [that is, the "
independence of the small nations] while not respecting it 
"[the rights of the small nations] themselves?"" The ability "
"to talk without acting, which, Mr. Gresham admitted to "
"some of his confidential Republican friends, was a charac "
"teristic of many of the Democrats of post-bellum days, "
still subsists. 1 

"From a favorable place right over the stage, I watched "
the Taft-Roosevelt convention of 1912. My sympathies

"and premises, his course was logical and patriotic. Accord "
"ing ,to statements made to me by men who were close to "
"Mr. Roosevelt, he hesitated not a moment when it was "
put up to him that the Republican leaders thought they 
"had tied his hands, and that it was his duty as a patriot "
and a man to walk out. Among his supporters were the

We re-affirm the position thrice announced by the Democracy in the National Con 
vention assembled against a policy of Imperialism and colonial exploitation in the Philippines 
"and elsewhere. We condemn the experiment in Imperialism as an inexcusable blunder, which "
"has brought us weakness instead of strength, and laid our Nation open to the charge of abandon "
ment of the fundamental doctrine of self government. 

We favor an immediate declaration of this Nation s purpose to recognize the indepen 
"dence of the Philippine Islands as soon as a stable government can be established, such "
independence to be guaranteed by us until the neutralization of the Islands can be secured by 
treaty and other forces. In recognizing the independence of the Philippines our Government 
should retain such land as may be necessary for coaling stations and naval locations.

and to the fact that Walter Q. Gresham thought that such 
"a tax would be constitutional, 1 in time of peace and pressed "
for it in the Wilson Tariff law. While President Cleveland 
"did not advocate an income tax, he never questioned its "
"constitutionality. 1 Most of his New York friends, as well "
as his New York democratic opponents like Tammany and 
"Senator Hill, opposed such a tax as unconstitutional. "
Senator (soon to become Associate Justice) White was 
supposed to favor an income tax. Ex-Secretary of the 
Treasury Benjamin H. Bristow 2 and Joseph H. Choate as 
attorneys for the New York bankers denounced it to Sec 
"retary of State Gresham as ""Populistic."" 3 The same argu "
ment they afterwards made in the Supreme Court. After 
Senator Hill had defeated in turn the confirmation of two 
"of Mr. Cleveland s friends, the eminent New York lawyers, "
"Peckham and Hornblower, for Associate Justice of the "
"Supreme Court, Secretary of State Gresham said, ""Send in "
"Senator White s name, he has been a member of the Su "
preme Court of Louisiana and senatorial courtesy will force 
"Senator Hill to accept him."" I heard William Jennings "
Bryan use Justice White s dissenting opinion in getting the 
Democratic nomination in i8g6. 4 That and Justice Harlan s 
dissenting opinion made the i6th or Income Tax Amendment 
inevitable. 5 Justice Harlan said an income tax is the fairest 
of all taxes while Justice White said it had the sanction of 
the illustrious man who was first president of the Republic. 
"As to the ""punches"" and ""licks,"" Walter 0. Gresham said, "
"I can and must stand them. 6 But as it turned out, he "
"did not get as many as he expected, when he broke away "
from the Republican party due perhaps to the belief that 
he could stand all that might be landed and strike back 
still harder.

"A hotel was no place for the Secretary of State to live, "
said some of our critics. That objection had been made 
by me to my husband s accepting a place in Mr. Cleveland s 
"cabinet. Carl Schurz approved going to a hotel, although "
it involved declining the gift of a house and of the sum of 
"$50,000 properly to maintain it, from kind and well-mean "
ing friends. In those days the Arlington Hotel was made 
up in part by including what were once private homes. We 
had part of what had been Charles Sumner s residence. 
To our west was a lawn and then the handsome residence 
of the Misses Stewart who had been much in Washington 
"society, especially in Arthur s time. One morning, T. E. "
"Roessell, the proprietor of the Arlington, said to his chief "
"man, ""Bennett, step over to the Misses Stewart, tell them "
"I wish to enlarge my hotel, and will they please put a price "

compliments to Mr. Roessell. They desire to extend their 
lawn. Will the proprietor of the Arlington please put a 
price on his hotel ? 

I have already mentioned the American game of which

"Quay and Vest, at two o clock in the morning, had agreed "
to kill the Force Bill and pass the McKinley Bill. After 
the consummation of that deal there was no just ground 
for criticizing Walter Q. Gresham for withdrawing his alle 
giance to the party that had been founded on the theory

"Senator Gray of Delaware, a very intimate friend, fre "
quently dined with us. For a long time there would be 
"one, two, or three Southern men, members of the Senate "
"or House, with us for dinner men like Speaker Crisp, of "
"Georgia, Senator Walthal of Mississippi, Jones of Arkansas, "
"Daniels of Virginia, and I believe every Southern senator "
excepting Senator Morgan of Alabama and Senator Gorham 
of Maryland. Frequently men from the South who were 
"not in the Senate or House, especially any ex-Confederate "
"who came to town and called at the State Department, "
were brought home to dinner. The Southern people had 
"received us most cordially, and naturally we returned their "
warmth. It was thus even in Mr. Arthur s time. Then 
"it was that Mr. Gresham was more intimate personally, "
"aside from his army friends, with the men who had worn "
the gray than with those from any other section. Some 
"times he would say, ""If the men who did the fighting can "
"get together, the churchmen North and South ought to re "
"sume their old relations."" "

These dinners were purely social ones. They were my 
husband s chief means of relaxation and recreation. It 
"was the way he had done while on the bench, bringing "
lawyers on both sides home to dinner. I was the only 
"woman present. There was no politics, in the small- sense, "
"talked, but every legal, religious, moral, military, and eco "
nomic question that men are interested in was discussed. 
And there were good stories by the score that have never 
"been in print. One of Senator Walthal s I must relate, "
because it illustrates the loyalty of the Southern negro to 
the white man and why negroes are to-day on the pension 
rolls of some of the Southern States. 

In one of the few battles in which we got the worst

In establishing and maintaining intimate and cordial

international affairs. We have shown how he had been

"As time went on that cordiality increased. Murphy, the "
"Tammany Senator of New York, said that he wanted Secre "

same avowals. I have described the Democratic National 
"Convention of 1896. On the platform, in the face of that "
"assemblage and before any nomination had been made, "
"Senator Jones of Arkansas, chairman of the Democratic "
"National Committee, told me, ""Had Judge Gresham lived "
"he would have been our man."" I mention this simply to "
meet the claim that was put forth that it was a personal 
and political mistake for Walter O. Gresham to change 
his party allegiance he never changed his principles -and 
to become Secretary of State under President Cleveland. 
"He lost not the confidence, friendship or support of news "
"paper men of mature years, like Joseph Medill and Morris "
"Ross, nor of youths like James P. Hornaday. I know that "
Mr. Gresham intended that portfolio to be his last official 
"position. That he did not want, and would not take, a "
place on the Supreme Bench when Justice Blatchford died

During the progress of the Chinese-Japanese War both 
"Kurino and Yang-Yu, the Japanese and Chinese ministers, "
were in daily conference with my husband. He was much 
criticized by even as good a friend as Carl Schurz because 
he required our legation in Pekin to give up two Japanese 
students who had entered the lines of the Chinese army as 
"spies. In order to escape recapture, the Japanese entered "
our legation. After they were delivered up to the Chinese 
they were executed. The Japanese government made no 
"complaint, for it realized that the right of asylum which "
was accorded to political offenders could not be a precedent 
in such a case. To restore the two spies to Japan would 
have made our government a party to the surreptitious 
gaining of information. That Mr. Gresham viewed his 
"action in this case with confidence, a few lines from a letter "
"to Noble C. Butler under date of January 13, 1895, will "
suffice to show: The correspondence on the subject of 
the two Japanese spies in China will go to the Senate next 
Monday. I have no fear of the result. My position there 
"is as unassailable as in the Bluefields case."" "

"Schurz, who had been a revolutionist in Germany, argued "
that spies in time of war had the same status as political 
offenders or revolutionists. The right of asylum in the 



THE END 817 

"case of spies, however, was denied by Secretary Gresham, "
"and when the t\vo Japanese were given up and executed, "
the former intimate relations with Mr. Schurz ceased. 
"Secret diplomacy was not part of Mr. Gresham s policy, "
and he said be could always get at least one newspaper man 
"to stand for ""right and justice,"" who withal was discreet. "

"What Walter 0. Gresham had in mind, in the event "
that he survived the four years in the State Department 
"or, in the meantime, broke with Mr. Cleveland, was to "
go back to the farm and deliver a series of lectures on 
Domestic and International Law in connection with the 
University of Chicago. This was his declared intention. 
"Without entangling alliances of any kind, that there "
"would have been something about Bright and justice"" in "
domestic and international relations not exactly according 
"to the conventional thought, those who have followed these "
"pages will admit, even though they might criticize. "

"As Lamartine said, ""Besides, these pretended divisions "
of power are always fictitious; power is never really di 
"vided."" It may be in the King or in the Parliament, and "
if the latter is composed of two assemblies it is in one or the 
"other, it is never in both; it may be in a victorious gener "
"al as was Napoleon long before he was crowned Emperor, "
when he mowed down the commerce of Paris with his can 
non; it may be in some individual of lofty understanding 
and commanding conscience; or it may be in a simple law 
"yer advancing a principle of morals, especially if that prin "
ciple be recognized in the fundamental law of the land. 

Wendell Phillips appealed to the honest men who would 
come hereafter when he could not pull the statesmen of 
this time away from that pro-slavery constitution. Wal 
ter 0. Gresham had helped on the battlefield to write into 
"that constitution the natural and inherent right of men, "
and he intended to urge on the living the importance to the 
race of the Republic of living up to these principles in do 
mestic 1 and international relations. The mass of mankind

"had not as yet learned that institutions are but ideas, and "
"that those ideas, when overthrown, involve in their fall "
thrones and nations. 

"Years and disease, pestilence and famine, never alter "

"of them lose their power not simply the power, that goes "
with official position and favors to give. That loss did not 
come to Walter Q. Gresham.

 / T A HE errors we see in histories of our times and affairs 
"-*- weaken our faith in ancient histories."" 1 As bearing "
on this I submit a memorandum of a talk in 1891 which 
"two lawyers had with Judge Gresham, supplied by William "
"R. Plum, General Thomas s Chief Telegrapher and author "
"of a very interesting work, ""Telegraphy of the War."" He "
became a lawyer and a good one. 2 

"Friday, February 26, 1891, Showalter (J. W.) and myself "
called on Judge Gresham at his chambers in relation to the suit 
of Keeler vs. Reynolds. From that our conversation soon drifted 
"to war matters, which we discussed for about an hour and a half, "
Gresham doing most of the talking. Among other things he said 
he was in command at Savannah when the battle of Shiloh began; 
that General Grant was in his tent when he first heard the cannon 
opening the battle. Both were smoking in quiet conversation 
when the sound of cannon came plainly down the river; that the 
steamer always had steam up and Grant promptly had his staff 
on board and started for Shiloh ; that there was no sort of doubt 
but Grant was taken by surprise; the Judge knew he was. He 
"had carefully noted what the General says in his book, and though "
he does not say in so many words that he was not surprised yet 
"he does leave that inference, which the Judge says was an unfair "
one. He further said that Sherman was back on the Ohio (Pa- 
"ducah, I think he said) when Grant ordered him to report to him, "
that the order was not warranted because Sherman was expected 
"to remain where he was until released by the War Department, "
"but Grant boldly ordered him to the front, and it was important "
as Sherman was somewhat under a cloud then to shield Sherman; 
that Grant had done more than any other man would have done 
to do that; that Grant had in apt time before the battle ordered 
Sherman in writing to reconnoiter in his front until he felt the 
enemy; that Sherman had reported on that order before the battle

and Grant was not anxious for fear of an attack that it would 
be interesting to have those two papers; that Colonel Worthing- 
ton charged a surprise and published a pamphlet to that effect; 
that that was just the course vSherman would have (or did) prefer 
Worthington to take; that it enabled Sherman to arrest Worth 
ington and try him by court martial; that that was what Worth- 
"ington expected and wished, as he intended thereby to prove the "
"facts of a surprise, but Worthington, though a very bright old "
"army officer, was not a lawyer and did not know or appreciate "
that he would be tried for insubordination; that the course 
Worthington should have taken would have been to prefer charges 
against his superior officer and thus raise the question of surprise 
fairly and legitimately; that Gresham was one of the officers ap 
pointed by Sherman to try Worthington; that there were (I 
think he said) fifteen officers in all in the court; that one of the 
first objections made was that Sherman could not prefer charges 
"and designate the court; that that question was argued, but he "
was the only member of the court that voted to sustain the ob 
jection. It seemed to him then and ever as contrary to our insti 
tutions to allow such a thing. He spoke of other members who 
"were lawyers by profession, and who must have known better "
than to have voted against the objection. Speaking of the battle 
"itself, he said that in the Worthington trial vSherman testified that "
"Grant rode over to Sherman and said, ""How is it going?"" ""Bad "
"enough, bad enough, bad enough,"" said Sherman; that he looked "
"at Grant and found him so unperturbed that he, Sherman, took "
"fresh hope; that Grant said he would hold his own, keeping the "
enemy at bay the rest of the day; that at night the enemy would 
be in possession of his camp and be in no shape to resist an early 
"attack in the morning, when Grant said we would pounce on them "
and drive them pell-mell ; that such was his plan and it would have 
been successful even without Buell s help. 



APPENDIX B 



T A HE following is an abstract of a speech delivered at 
"-^ New Albany, Indiana, October 4, 1864, by Colonel "
"John M. Harlan, afterwards Justice of the United States "
"Supreme Court, from which we have quoted on page 347. "
It shows better than anything the opposition there was in 
the South to the Abolitionists and how the Union pro- 
slavery men of Kentucky turned against Mr. Lincoln on 
"the negro question, and is in strong contrast with the ut "
terances of Associate Justice Harlan. 

Colonel Harlan took the stand and delivered one of the best 
speeches of the campaign. We arc furnished with the following 
"abstract, which is but a faint outline of his remarks. "

He commenced by referring to the time when Kentuckians 
"came to the rescue of Indiana, when the people were threatened "
with destruction by the merciless savage. 

"Years rolled by, and when Kentucky was invaded by the "
"armies of the rebellion, Indiana came to the rescue. "

The first regiment which came to Kentucky from a free 
State was the Sixth Indiana under Colonel Crittenden. The 
last which came was the glorious band of Braves composing the 
"Tenth Indiana, then commanded by Colonel afterwards General "
"--Mahlon D. Manson, now Democratic candidate for lieutenant- "
governor. 

lie referred to the intimacy and cordial feeling which existed 
in the army between the soldiers of Indiana and Kentucky. They 
"mingled as brothers, and have fought side by side upon many "
battlefields in this bloody civil war. The interests of the people 
"of Indiana and Kentucky were identical, their destiny should and "
"he believed would, be the same. For his own part he would never "
consent to see Kentucky and Indiana separated and living under 
different hostile governments. 

"He then alluded to the contest of 1860, resulting in the elec "
"tion of Abraham Lincoln as President an event which, while "
"it afforded no occasion for the dissolution of the Union, gave an "

823



824 APPENDIX B 

opportunity to bad men of both sections to excite sectional feel 
ing and disrupt the Union. That party should never have tri 
"umphed, because it was based upon the single idea of hate and "
hostility to the social institution of one section of our country; 
its candidate having been elected in accordance with the Con 
"stitution, he was entitled to be respected as President. "

"The disunionists of the South, however, were not content to "
await the slow process of the ballot box. They fired upon the 
flag of the United States and then aroused the entire people of 
"the North, including those who felt and believed that the Aboli "
tionists could have averted the terrible calamity of civil war had 
they been actuated by that spirit of conciliation and compromise 
in which the Constitution was framed by our Fathers. 

But for what purpose did the people of the North rise as one 
"man? It was to maintain the Union, and the Constitution which "
was the only bond of that Union. It was for the high and noble 
purpose of asserting the binding authority of our laws over every 
part of this land. It was not for the purpose of giving freedom 
to the negro. He referred to the Crittenden resolutions as indi 
cating the unanimous opinion of Congress as to the object of the 
"war, so far as the people of the loyal States were concerned. "

Mr. Lincoln has in disregard of the then declared purpose of 
the nation changed and perverted the character of the war. He 
is warring chiefly for the freedom of the African race. He will 
not be content with simply re-establishing the authority of the 
Constitution and restoring the Union. 

He will not accept peace upon any terms which do not embrace 
the abandonment by the South of its local institutions. The 
purpose he has in view is impossible of accomplishment. He 
can not restore the Union that way. The war will be almost 
interminable upon such basis. The Rebel army may be crushed 
"and dissipated, but under the policy of Mr. Lincoln the Union "
can never be restored in the hearts and affections of the people 
of the South. 

"The original policy of the war was the true one, and had it "
"been adhered to, we would ere this have built up a peace party "
in the South which would have paralyzed the efforts of bad men 
"there, who, in connection with their Abolition confreres in the "
"North, have brought this terrible civil war upon us. "



APPENDIX B 825 

Common sense would seem to have dictated that in the man 
agement of this great rebellion our national authorities should 
have so acted as to produce a rupture between the people South 
and their wicked leaders. He also reviewed and criticized Air. 
"Lincoln s plan of reconstruction. That plan, if it prevailed, "
would work a civil revolution in our system of government- 
Mr. Lincoln has in that respect assumed unlimited and uncon 
stitutional powers. He holds and exercises the power to subvert 
"State government, and he even prescribes the terms upon which "
people may vote. 

"A loyal man in Alabama, who has been true to his country "
"and has been a soldier in the War of 1812 and the Mexican War, "
could not vote in re-establishing civil authority in the State unless 
he would first take Lincoln s oath to become an Abolitionist. 
The triumph of abolition would be the triumph of a spirit which 
in order to effect its purpose would not hesitate to trample upon 
constitutions and laws with impunity. There is no safety in 
this land of ours except in rigid adherence to law no safety for 
"life, liberty, or property. "

In opposition to this fundamental principle Lincoln says he 
has the right to disregard the Constitution in whole or in part 
to whatever extent he pleases whenever he deems it necessary 
to take the notion. 

"He referred to McClellan, his life record, etc.; demonstrated "
that he was the representative of that spirit of conservatism that 
respected the Constitution and the laws. 

He had adhered to the Constitution in whatever position he 
had been placed. 

"He would never consent to a dissolution of the Union, but if "
elected would so exert the power of the nation as to give us peace 
"peace with an unbroken Constitution, peace upon the basis of "
the Union of our fathers. 

Lincoln commenced with a united North and a divided South. 
He now has a divided North and a united South. 

Colonel Harlan in conclusion said he was an unconditional 
"Union man, unconditional for the Union and the Constitution. "

An Abolitionist is for the Union on condition that slavery is 
abolished. A Secessionist is for the Union if at all only on 
condition that slavery is preserved.

I have the honor to enclose you a copy of a letter from 
His Excellency Governor Morton of Indiana to Colonel W. Q. 
"Gresham, Fifty-third Indiana Infantry, a part of my command, "
and to request that the attention of the Secretary of War may 
be called to it. 

Without any reference to the misunderstanding between the 
"Governor and Colonel Gresham, I desire simply to say that there "
appears too much of a disposition on the part of His Excellency 
to consider the officers and soldiers furnished by the State for the 
service of the United States as within control of the State exec 
"utive as to military rewards and punishments, and that this is a "
growing evil tending to break up proper subordination and re 
spect to their military superiors. The threat included in the 
last paragraph is an assumption of power.

The following are some of the protests that went to 
President Lincoln against the threat of Governor Morton 
to have Colonel Gresham dismissed. 



828 APPENDIX C 

"To His EXCELLENCY, ABRAHAM LINCOLN, "
PRESIDENT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. 

SIR: Understanding that an effort is about to be made by 
Governor Morton of Indiana to procure the dismissal of W. Q. 
"Gresham, Colonel Fifty-third Indiana Infantry, from the service, "
"I feel it no less a duty as a lover of my country, respectfully to "
"petition against the dismissal of so valuable an officer, than a "
"pleasure as an admirer of Colonel Gresham, to bear testimony to "
"his high merit as a gentleman, an officer, and a patriot. "

"The cause of this effort on the part of Governor Morton, I "
"am reliably informed, is a personal difficulty between himself "
and Colonel Gresham which has grown out of a private corre 
spondence a copy of which will be sent you and not from any 
failure on the part of the Colonel to perform his whole duty to 
the entire satisfaction of all with whom he has been connected. 

Since the Battle of Shiloh I have been intimately associated 
"with the Colonel, .eight months of the time in the same brigade "
"and all the time in the same division with him; and at all times, "
"whether on the march, in camp, or in the field, I have found "
"him prompt, faithful, and efficient. lie is intensely loyal and has "
promptly endorsed all measures of the government for crushing 
"this unholy rebellion, adopting as his motto, ""Right or wrong, "
"always my country."" "

"His dismissal from the service would not only wrong him, but "
"do great injustice to his regiment, and rob our country of the "
services of one of her most ardent supporters whose ability as an 
officer is equaled by few and surpassed by none in the volunteer 
service. 

"Hoping that neither the honor of a true man, the reputation "
"of an able officer, nor the interests of the cause so dear to us all . "
"may be sacrificed for the gratification of personal spleen, I am, "
"with profoundest regard, "

"Your most obedient servant, "

"Colonel of the Fifty-third Regiment, Indiana Volunteers Infantry, "
and that in consequence of said misunderstanding an attempt 
may be made to have Colonel Gresham dismissed from the serv

I therefore beg leave most respectfully to say that I have been 
"acquainted with Colonel W. 0. Gresham, have been intimately "
"associated with him, and have had the very best opportunity to "
know him as a gentleman and officer during the last ten months. 

I am therefore happy to have this opportunity to testify as 
to his undoubted loyalty and eminent ability as an officer. He has 
always during our acquaintance shown himself to be one of the 
"most worthy, competent, and efficient officers in the Brigade. "
The service and the regiment would suffer an irreparable loss by 
"his dismissal from the service, which would be considered very "
unjust and would be greatly deplored by all who know him.

should succeed in his effort that then our country and cause would 
"be deprived of one of its most true, faithful, and loyal officers "

officer; I deem it my duty in justice to my country as well as to 
a worthy officer to protest earnestly against the same. 

Having served for a long time in the same brigade with Colonel 
"Gresham and being well acquainted with him, I can say of my "
own knowledge that he has always conducted himself in an

fully and earnestly solicit a hearing in his behalf. I will be brief 
and to the point at once. It appears that a misunderstanding 
is existing and has existed for some time between His Excellency 
Governor Morton of Indiana and Colonel W. Q. Gresham of the 
Fifty-third Regiment Indiana Volunteer Infantry. 

"This difficulty, which I understand to be of a strictly private "
"nature, has progressed to such an extent that His Excellency the "
"Governor has presented him, the Colonel, the choice of resigning "
his commission or of submitting to a dishonorable dismissal from 
"the service. The Colonel desires, as does every patriot and soldier, "
to continue in the service and in the position which he now fills 
"with so much ability, that he may the better discharge the duty "
"which he owes to his country; and he simply asks, as an act of "
"simple justice, that he may not be disgraced in the eyes of the "
"world on account of the difficulty, strictly private in its character, "
"of little if any importance, and with a gentleman in civil life. "

"It affords me great pleasure to be able to state, and upon the "
"honor of an officer and a gentleman, that the Colonel is an un "
"doubtedly loyal man, an unflinching and devoted patriot, and an "
officer of whose ability to correctly and properly discharge the 
duties of his office there can be no doubt; and I do further 
humbly request that he may at least have a fair trial before a 
calamity so great shall befall him.

I am perfectly cognizant of his efficient and successful labors 
in raising portions of two regiments since the breaking out of this 
rebellion. 

I anxiously trust that if any attempt should be made to pro 
"cure the summary dismissal of Colonel Gresham from the service, "
the inclosed papers from his brother officers may receive the 
consideration they justly merit.

"HEADQUARTERS, POST NATCHEZ, Miss., "

"November i, 1863 "

GENERAL: I have been admonished by some of my friends 
that an appointment as brigadier-general is not always confirmed 
by the Senate. I once explained to you the nature of a difficulty 
I had with a few of the politicians of Indiana who may think that 
"now is the time to strike me. If such opposition should be made, "
I could easily silence it by agreeing to certain things which I think 
"involve my self-respect and manhood, and which I cannot do. "
"I have no fears of trouble from the Senators from Indiana, for "
"they will both vote f r me, but Governor Morton might work "
against me if he thinks he can do so secretly. 

"You know I never sought promotion, and General Grant, and "
"I don t know who else, presented my name without my knowledge, "
which I confess is gratifying to me. 

If politicians had forced me on the army as brigadier-general 
I would have no right to think hard if the Senate should refuse 
"to pass me, but inasmuch as I was promoted on the recommenda "
"tion of my commanding officers, unsolicited on my part, I think "
it would be hard to be rejected and disgraced. I would infinitely 
prefer being killed in action. 

"I have always felt free to approach you for advice, and I there "
"fore drop you this note. Your brother, Hon. John Sherman. I "
"know has as much, if not more, influence than any other man in "
"the Senate, and I should like very much to have him understand "



APPENDIX C 835 

my case. If you think it necessary to drop him a note on the 
subject you will place me under renewed obligations by doing so. 
"I shall always feel grateful to you, for I feel that I am indebted "
to you for my promotion. 

"I am commanding the Third Brigade, Fourth Division, Seven "
"teenth Army Corps. I also have charge of the Post, but I would "
very much prefer being with you in the field. 
"I am, General, "

"Very truly your friend, "

"W. Q. GRESHAM, "

"MAJOR-GENERAL W. T. SHERMAN, Brig.-Genl. "

Commanding Twenty-fifth Army Corps. 

"HEADQUARTERS DEPT. ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE, "

"BRIDGEPORT, November 18, 1863 "
"HON. JOHN SHERMAN, "
"WASHINGTON, D. C. "

DEAR BROTHER : W. Q. Gresham has been properly appointed 
a brigadier-general of the army by the President. He writes me 
from Natchez saying that it is possible certain Indiana influences 
may be brought to bear against his confirmation. 

I know he has earned this appointment and should be con 
firmed. He was lieutenant-colonel of an Indiana regiment that 
"joined me on Muldroughs Hill in Kentucky, and early attracted "
my attention. I subsequently found him in Mississippi com 
"manding another regiment, and had General Grant s promise "
to transfer him to my corps in order that I could advance 
"him, but General Ord, in whose corps he was, would not spare him, "
"and promised me he would urge his promotion, which he did, "
"and Gresham is now a brigadier-general, and only fears some old "
political combinations may stand between him and confirmation. 
I ask you to make a note of his name. I pledge you my word 
he is a fine gentleman and bids fair to be an elegant soldier. You 
"know I judge of men on the field, and there is where Gresham is "
and has been. He too is of that modest school that strives to 
deserve advancement by work and not heralding his heroism in 
"the journals of the day. I send this letter through him, and "
"anything he adds to it, I indorse. "

"Affectionately, etc., W. T. SHERMAN, "

Major-General. 



APPENDIX D 



"following is the letter in full, of Richard Olney, "
which is alluded to in Chapter XLVII on the 
Hawaiian affair. 

(Private) 

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 

"WASHINGTON, D. C., October 9, 1893 "
"HON. WALTER Q. GRESHAM, "
SECRETARY OF STATE. 

MY DEAR JUDGE: The Hawaii business strikes me as not 
"only important, but as one that may require great delicacy in the "
handling. 

"There is no question, it seems to me, that a great wrong was "
done under the auspices of United States Minister Stevens when 
the regular constitutional government of the queen was supplanted 
"and the present, so-called, provisional government installed in "
its stead. 

"There is no question either, I think, of the good sense, the "
"statesmanship, and the sound morality of your proposition that "
"this great wrong should be rectified, and that to rectify it the "
status quo at the time of its perpetration must as far as possible 
be restored. 

The queen s government was overthrown by an exhibition of 
force. If it can be reinstated by a like exhibition of force without 
"actual resort to it, there is not, it seems to me, any real ground for "
hesitation. Whether the exhibition of force in each case be or be 
"not a technical act of war, the undoing of the original wrong by "
the same means by which it was consummated would hardly be 
criticized in any quarter and would probably be universally com 
mended as an act of substantial justice. It would be the short 
and ready way out of the complication if the Stevens government 
were a thing of a few hours or even a few days existence. 

But the present situation is not so simple. The queen has 
"been in our hands, and the Stevens government has been in "
authority with our acquiescence for many months. All parties 

836



APPENDIX D 837 

have been awaiting the action of the United States. In the 
interim the Stevens government has had complete possession of 
"the country and all its resources, and may have acquired such "
control of them and such ascendency over the inhabitants that 
it can be displaced only by actual force and after more or less 
loss of life and destruction of property. 

"In any event, and whether the Stevens government will be "
"fought for or not, it has in this interval been receiving the revenues "
"of the country, collecting the taxes, administering justice, and "
"enforcing the laws, and generally exercising all the functions of "
a legitimate government. 

"This being the situation, let the worst be assumed; namely, "
"that as a matter of fact, the Stevens government cannot be ousted "
except by the application of superior military force. To that 
"course there are, it seems to me, various formidable objections. "
"One is, that a resort to military force would be clearly an act of "
"war, however righteous the cause, and would be beyond the "
"President s constitutional power. Another is, that to hand over "
to the queen s government a country more or less devastated 
and a people more or less diminished in number and alienated in 
"feeling by a contest of arms, would produce a result that would "
be but a poor substitute for that peaceful control over an unin 
jured territory and undecimated population which the queen s 
government enjoyed at the time of United States Minister Stevens 
lawless intervention in its affairs. 

"Still another, and to my mind, an insuperable, objection, is "
this: The Stevens government will not be fought for unless its 
"adherents are sure of a strong backing not merely in warlike force, "
but in the intelligent public sentiment both of Hawaii and of 
this country. If such sentiment has grown up and now exists 
in Hawaii and we know to how large an extent it prevails in 
this country -the administration in undertaking to reinstate the 
queen s government by force of arms would be open to the reproach 
of sacrificing the interests of the country and its people to the 
interests of the queen s government and her dynasty. It would 
not be sufficient to urge that the queen s government had been 
"unlawfully deposed by the United States, and that they were "
merely endeavoring to right that wrong. The answer would be 
that the queen and her government were not the only and first 



838 APPENDIX D 

things to be considered; that the paramount objects of our care 
should be the people of Hawaii and their interests; that we have 
no right to redeem the original wrong by the commission of 
"another still greater wrong, to wit, the imposition on Hawaii of "
a government not wanted by its people; and that if through their 
"experience of the Stevens government, or otherwise, the people "
of Hawaii are now sincerely opposed to any restoration of the 
"queen s government, the United States would have no right to "
"insist upon such restoration, but must find some other means of "
compensating the queen and all others immediately injured by 
the unlawful setting up of the Stevens government. 

The above suggestions are not made because serious resistance 
by arms to anything the United States may do in Hawaii is to be 
reasonably anticipated. It is wholly unlikely. At the same time 
"it is the unexpected that proverbially happens in politics, and in "
"shaping its present policy, the administration ought, so far as it "
"can, to take into consideration every contingency, however remote. "
Let it now be assumed that any contest of arms by the Stevens 
government is out of the question the administration in deter 
"mining its course upon that theory can not, I think, properly "
lose sight of certain considerations of vital importance. The 
"Stevens government is the lawful government of the country, "
and has been and is recognized as such by the United States and 
"by foreign nations. However legitimate in its origin, it has since "
"governed by the consent of all parties. It follows that its acts, "
"unless shown to be mala fide, ought to be recognized as legal to "
all intents and purposes. It follows that all the officers of that 
"government, from the highest to the lowest, ought to be exempt "
from any loss or punishment or from any fear of loss or punish 
"ment in consequence of their official actions. In my judgment, "
the honor of the United States is hardly less concerned in securing 
justice and fair play for the Stevens government and its members 
"and adherents, than in the restoring to power of the queen s "
constitutional government. It must ever be remembered that 
the Stevens government is our government ; that it was set up 
by our minister by the aid of our naval and military forces and 
was accorded the protection of our flag; and that whatever be 
"the views of this administration, its predecessor practically sanc "
tioned everything Minister Stevens took upon himself to do. 



APPENDIX D 839 

"Under such circumstances, to permit the men who were Stevens "
instruments in this setting up and carrying on of the Stevens 
"government, and who undoubtedly acted in good faith and in "
the sincere belief that Stevens correctly represented his govern 
"ment to permit these men to be hung or banished, or despoiled "
"of their estates, or otherwise punished for their connection with "
"the Stevens government, or to leave them exposed to the risks "
"of any such consequences, would, it seems to me, be grossly unjust "
"and unfair, and would deservedly bring the government of the "
United States into great discredit both at home and abroad. 

The practical conclusions I arrive at from the foregoing are 
these : 

1. All the resources of diplomacy should be exhausted to 
restore the status quo in Hawaii by peaceful methods and without 
force. 

"2. If, as a last resort, force is found to be necessary by "
force I mean an act or course of acts amounting to war the 
matter must be submitted to Congress for its action. 

3. In addition to providing for the security of the queen s 
"person pending efforts to reinstate the Queen s government, and "
"as a condition of making such efforts, the United States should "
require of the queen and any other legal representatives of her 
government full power and authority to negotiate and bring 
about the restoration of her government on such reasonable 
terms and conditions as the United States may approve and find 
to be practicable. 

"Among such terms and conditions must be, I think, full pardon "
and amnesty for all connected with the Stevens government who 
might otherwise be liable to be visited with the pains and penalties 
attending the crime of treason. 

"4. The negotiations above recommended would, I have no "
"doubt, have a successful issue. It would be understood that the "
"power of the United States was behind them, while there would "
be and need be no statement nor intimation of the necessity for 
"the intervention of Congress, if it were found necessary to reen- "
force the negotiations by the use of the war power. The negoti 
"ations being in the hands of the United States, and it being known "
"that it would insist upon, fair dealing not merely for the queen s "
"government but for all others concerned, the chief motive for "



840 APPENDIX D 

standing out on the part of the adherents of the Stevens govern 
ment would be taken away. While in doubt as to the policy 
"of the restored queen s government toward them, they would "
naturally be disinclined to consent to any change in the existing 
status. That doubt being dispelled and all apprehension of severe 
"or vindictive measures toward them being removed, it is to be "
"anticipated, I think, that they would readily follow the course "
recommended by the United States. 

I trust you will not regard this as an unnecessary intrusion 
upon your time or an uncalled-for meddling with affairs especially 
in your care. Neither charge me in your thoughts with imagining 
that there is anything especially valuable in it or anything that 
would not occur to yourself. I write because of my general interest 
in the subject and because an expression of opinion from each 
member of the cabinet seemed to be invited last Friday. Wish 
"ing I had something better to offer, I am "

"Very truly yours, "

(Signed) RICHARD OLNEY.
